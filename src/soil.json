      "Description": "As we are driving down the freeway, I see a man standing in the triangle of pavement where the on-ramp lanes merge into normal lanes. He is playing violin for the traffic. We check into our suite, crash for just a few, and catch a ride to Roma. The taco shop we want is closed. We walk for just a minute and find two nice ladies who make us biztec and campechano tacos, which are amazing. We wander from Roma to the park. A man is playing a type of small, hand-cranked nickelodeon and is having a blast doing it. We stop by a large fountain and gaze at the goddess Diana's incredible butt. We head into the park. Appreciate some clothes statues and then catch a cab to Quintonil. Our reservation is for 3:45. By 6, we are ten courses deep plus a hacienda margarita and a Ramos Gin Fizz. Everything is incredible. We explore a nearby square, visit a Sally store, and then sleep for 15 hours.<br><br>After a mediocre hotel breakfast we head to the anthropological museum. In the park outside the museum there is an exercise class doing Pulp Fiction esque dance moves to Rock around the Clock. A minute further along, we hear live flute and drum. We pass through the trees to see where it's coming from and find four men in elaborate costume hanging upside-down and spinning from a 100 foot pole. They are playing the music. As they spin, their ropes lower slowly towards the ground. It is called Danza de los Voladores, Dance of the Flyers. Next we do the museum, which is massive and stunning. There are a few temple facade reconstructions, which are particularly impressive. After tasty elotes, tlayudas, and horchata on the street we walk through the park for a good while. At one point we hear the same flute and drum music. We look around for another group of swinging men, but I don't see them. After a minute Liz pulls out her phone to realize she had the video of them playing in her pocket. We tire out and get a cab to Baltra, a cocktail bar in Roma. After a clarified horchata punch we walk through a park where a very talented man is doing Beatles covers with an elaborate one-man-band setup on his back. A al pastor vendor on the street grabs our attention and we dine on incredible street tacos. Next is Licoreria Limantour where, when we ask the host how long the wait will be, we are informed that time is relative, but probably around 30 minutes. After longer than that we give up and get a ride to Taqueria Los Cocuyos for tacos with mostly non muscle meats. I'm not sure what we had, but at least one was tripa. They were good though. We walk for about 20 and land in Plaza Garibaldi, which is the center for mariachi music in the city. There are dozens of bands hanging out in full regalia. Many are playing for just one or two people. We take it all in for a while before settling on a nice looking Norteno group, who play us a groovy tune.<br><br>After a workout and a better breakfast we get a ride to Teotihuacan. We arrive at the gates an hour later to be told it is closed for the rest of the day because they already hit capacity. Our driver recommends a canal area on the south side of town so we go for it. Almost another hour and a half later we arrive. We get tacos from a stand and hop on a colorful boat. The canal is jam packed with other boats, but the weather is great, the vibes are great, and there's beer in a bucket. Various vendors in canoes who pull up along side us to offer their goods. A woman is frying tortillas in one. In another a man is roasting corn. Some canoes have mariachi bands who will board boats and play for passengers. One canoe has a DJ who appears to be shooting a music video. After about an hour of bumper boat madness we break off down a quiet canal. The whole experience is lovely and nowhere near the tourist trap I was worried it might be. Back to the hotel to put on some Plan 9 from Outer Space for just a bit. Hanky Panky for cocktails and snacks. Just as we are about to leave we meet Ali and Amy, US & Canadian nomads who have been bouncing between Turkey and Mexico since September. We close down the bar chatting with them.<br><br>Neither of is feels 100% today so we take it easy, get some more tacos, tepache, and a quesadilla from down the street, and make out way back home.",

      "Description": "We nab the last spot at the Lewis Lake campsite and setup the tent. There is still a bit of light in the sky, so we drive to West Thumb, a hot spring and mud pot cluster. There are hundreds of craters in the ground ranging in size from toilet bowl to backyard pool. The liquid spectrum is clay slip to phone screen protector. All of the springs have water runoff, on which live bacterial mats that can take on colors like hot dog mustard, old car rust, gender confirming blue, and classic brown. The bits of old runoff which aren't actively wet are porcelain white; deposits of sodium carbonate the water had absorbed from the limestone below. I learn that Yellowstone National Park exists as the latex skin of a forty-mile diameter magma balloon which is being continuously filled. One day the balloon will pop and make the Earth unrecognizable for tens of thousands of years. Until then it will heat the water table and give life to the geysers, hot springs, and mud pots. I spot some people with cameras crowding together, usually a good sign. I walk over and see a big elk bull and a few elk cows. The bull looks horny and not pleased about the spectators. He looks at us, opens his mouth, and makes a loud scream akin to a child who is first learning to play a trumpet. We don't stick around much longer. Back to the campsite where our neighbor, Anthony, has a fire going. We make a peace offering of beer and join around the glow while we chat about Tucson and eat cold pizza. It is so cold out that we don't even consider sleeping in the already setup tent. I grab the blanket and bags from it and we settle into the back of the Jeep.<br><br>First stop is Old Faithful. We, very fortunately, get there only about twenty minutes before the next eruption is due to begin. We join the very large crowd and, before long, see it do its thing. It was the most viewed and least beautiful sight we'd see in the entire trip. Next to Grand Prismatic Spring, which is definitely one of the coolest sights of the trip. The microbial mats are so strongly colored, that the steam rising from the water takes on a rainbow spectrum. After failing to get signal for a while in Madison, we head to Canyon Village to check out the waterfalls and \"Yellowstone Grand Canyon\". The upper and lower falls are both stunning and the canyon is a feast for the senses I could easily spend hours taking in. Unfortunately, we didn't have that long. Our goal was to reach Hayden Valley, a vast grassy meadow, which we heard is perfect for wildlife viewing. A few minutes into the plains and we spot elk in the distance as well as bison, lots of bison. We park above a river and watch a few dozen bovines feed, drink, swim, and nap. The entire valley is steeped in tones of gold, straw, and amber. I am zoomed in at 300mm, taking in the gorgeous beasts and absorbed in the light and color. Time slows down a while. Slower than I expected, the light eventually fades and the even chill quickly kicks in. We drive to the nearest town, Gardiner, where we eat mediocre pizza and find a spot off the side of a road to park.<br><br>Up at six, which I will later find out wasn't early enough to see a pack of wolves chase a grizzly bear across the plains of Lamar Valley. We do arrive just after that though and are able to catch, very far off, a few wolves playing a game of bite the bison. Further down the road about thirty bison are not only right next to the road, but are crossing it regularly, ever in search of the finest blade of grass to ruminate on. It makes for a perfect glamour shots session. We drive next to Mammoth Hot Springs where we chat with a few very friendly and knowledgeable rangers on topics like ranger uniform history, the evolution of forest fire management, and the idiosyncrasies of elk behavior. We first walk, then drive through Mammoth Hot Springs, which are unique in that the calcium carbonate deposits form stunning stepped travertine terraces. The thousand-year in the making sculptures look as though they were taken from the depths of cave. The bone white crust surrounding the active thermal areas adds to the eerie otherworldliness of the place. The day is still young and we are mentally finished with parking so we decide to drive to Spokane. Seven or so hours later we pickup two more duck banh mi, check into our hotel by the airport, and dream of things much bigger, and older, than ourselves.",

      "Description": "After a two-hour drive we're in Jackson, Wyoming. To a nice cafe for a delicious egg salad on toast and a five-mushroom latte. We drive to the southern tip of Jenny Lake. The Tetons are majestic: jagged and jutting suddenly upward from the flat valley due to one tectonic plate crashing with and slipping under another. There are a few small glaciers on the mountains, but they are melting fast and will be gone in a decade or so. We take a ferry and hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. It seems it snowed heavily last night and now big hunks of snow are falling from the tall pines. Early on I get smacked in the head by a big white dump. The hike is nice, but the ground is cold and wet, which my sock/sandal combo doesn't love. From above, Liz spots an entrancing vortex pattern in the intersecting ferry wakes. By the end of the hike the snow is melting to the point that it looks like it's raining from the trees. The sky is cloudless and blue. It's surreal. Back to Jackson where we order two large pizzas. We park in a camp spot that is already reserved. They pull in while we are brushing our teeth and aren't pleased. We find a new, unreserved spot and get real cold.<br><br>Apparently moose are quite plentiful in this area. I keep looking for them. As we drive back into Jackson to a coffee shop for drinks and a breakfast bagel sandwich, my eyes play tricks on me. Every dark tree in the distance is a potential moose. This is how people see Jesus in a dog's butt. Liz spots our server from the pizza restaurant at the grocery store. We visit the most-photographed barn in the world and take pictures of the barn next to it. Further north to Coulter Bay where we hike around a nice peninsula that wants to be an island. At the General Store we eat very good huckleberry ice cream. Continuing north we enter Yellowstone.",

      "Description": "In St. Regis we stop for roadside cherries and a huckleberry milkshake. To Kalispell for gas & groceries and then Blankenship Bridge where we camp along the river bank.<br><br>Up at 4:30. At 6 Logan Pass is already filling up. We catch some more sleep and get up around 7:30 to start hiking. Our plan was to do the Highline Trail, but a friendly ranger offers some better advice. First we do the Hidden Lake hike, a three-mile hike to a...hidden lake. On our hike Liz points out the moon. I say, \"Oh, hi!\" and point to it, but a woman in the path thinks I'm pointing at her. I tell her sorry, I was just saying hi to the moon. The lake is closed because of bear activity, but it is a nice view. There is a goat a few feet from me. At one point I think he might charge, but he puts his head down and continues chomping. We sit on a rock and eat peanut butter. Some ground squirrels are very interested in us. Later, a ranger will tell us her name for them, Little Cannibals. Apparently, when one gets hit by a car, others go out to eat it, and then also get hit by cars, resulting in a squirrel pile up. A Hoary Marmot poses for us for a good while. We relax in the car for a bit before we begin the Highline trail. The whole trail is 16 miles, so we opt to only do about a mile in and out. There are some narrow cliff sections, which are pretty scary. The view is incredible. There are something like three dozen glaciers in the park. All are a fraction of the size they were a few decades ago. They will likely all melt in my lifetime. What we think might be a pika says hi. We drive to the end of Going to the Sun Road, then back. To Josephine's for a bison gyro and fried chicken. Back to camp along the river where we chat with our neighbors and drink wine. The Milky Way hangs above.<br><br>The night was beautiful and just a bit cool, but at 7am the winds pick up and a serious cold front visits the region. Our next four days will be much colder than we packed for. We had booked a rafting trip, but when we get to the office they inform us it has been cancelled due to the wind. Our next stop is the Montana Mystery House & Vortex, which seemed like a quirky art installation on Atlas Obscura. However, in speaking to the desk attendant and seeing the gift shop it feels a lot more like a scheme designed to prey on the naive. Speaking of schemes designed to prey on the naive, just down the road from the Mystery House is a trailer semi-encircled by about 15 billboards, featuring the Ten Commandments, and statements about Jesus' ability to save my soul. I stop. Inside is a gift shop selling very large t-shirts, embroidered face masks, and car magnets; all detailing either the Ten Commandments or the healing properties of Jesus. I ask about the masks. The attendant tells me about the pastor in Oregon who believes we don't need masks (because god will heal us), but whom was instructed by God to make them to help financially support the church. He mentioned something about a divine discovery of an embroidery machine. I leave, but not before he tells me about how his Columbia shoes were very durable on his mission in Indonesia. Gyro & falafel in Missoula. In Idaho Falls we get a hotel, go to Walmart to buy long-sleeved shirts, and begin watching I'm Thinking of Ending Things.",

It is hot and salty and delicious. I am aware of how many homeless-looking people there are. We drive south through a cute neighborhood. Some of the quirky homes remind me how conservative Dallas is. We get water, beer, hard kombucha, and chips from a grocery store. Down the road is Manito Park, where we get out and eat a watery Massaman curry next to a small lake. We walk and find a French garden full of flowers and bees being bees. Back downtown, we stop into two vintage shops. I am tempted by scratched Paul Simon vinyl and a porch swing made from the bench of an old Ferris wheel. We check into the Historic Davenport and check out for a bit. The sun is now low in the sky. We pop out and walk to Riverfront Park where we feed the Garbage Goat, sit beneath the big top, and view the falls. We get a very good duck banh mi from Wild Sage and eat it in the room. For the second half of dinner we get a salad and Gorgonzola fries from Downriver Grill and also eat that in the room. We stop by the milk bottle, but it is not lit up.<br><br>We get free breakfast with our room so we head down. I order the crab omelette, which is okay and Liz has a salmon benedict. Back in the room we test out the mattress. Next to REI to buy poop bags. On the road east and to Coeur D'Alene Coffee Co. for some very nice drinks. Our plan was to stay here tonight, but in doing more research we decide it's best to head straight to Glacier. We walk by the lake and then drive east.",

We cuddle for a few and she heads to work. I sleep. After some failed internet login I opt to meditate and work out. I told myself I wouldn't drink caffeine on this trip. I'm already feeling it. I decide to check out a nearby art gallery...which it turns out I've already been to. The art, however, is all different and even better than last time. My favorite piece is a very large balloon that is on a loop of being inflated and deflated. At its peak, it pushes up against both walls and the ceiling. I also am quite fond of the pile of rubble, which is breathing. I get some fake meat and potato chips from a Chinese convenience store. I snack, dress, and walk. Liz meets me and we have a lovely dinner at sixpenny including kangaroo tartare, grouper with celeriac sauce and champagne foam, lovely beef, and Mead custard. Train and walk to Scout for some weird yummy drinks.<br><br>I sleep until 1. Liz gave me her drink voucher, so I head down to the bar where I have an XPA and chat with Joseph, the bartender, for a good while. I walk to Lankan Filling station and meet Liz for delicious Sri Lankan curries and hoppers. Then we get a ride to the Opera House and see the Marriage of Figaro, which is excellent and hard to follow, both in plot and music. We walk to Maybe Sammy for fancy drinks. We walk next to Employees Only, but don't like the basic drink club vibe, so we opt to go to bed. <br><br>Up early for our flight to Adelaide. Liz sleeps and I watch Parasite. We take a bus downtown. The town is a bit run down and there are many down and out folks hanging around. It is also charming with beautiful architecture and many cool looking shops. We stop by Lord of the Fries for poutine. We wander the high street for a good bit and I save Liz from sitting on bird poop. We walk down to Central Market and pick up cheese, terrine, kiwi, jam and tomatoes right before they close. We head back north and come upon a big square where we lie on the grass and sun ourselves for a good while. Hungry Jack's (Burger King) sells a vegan Rebel Whopper, son we try one and it is delicious. Next we head towards the Botanic Gardens where we take in the beautiful plants and birds for a good bit before heading to the airport to pick up our bags and a car. A good long drive. I see a kangaroo bounce across the road. We get to Cape Jervis, where we stay in a room for the night. There are many millipedes outside. We snack on a loaf of bread the folks at Sixpenny gave us, soft and hard cheese, fig jam, and terrine.<br><br>Up early and to the ferry over to Kangaroo Island where we get a rental car and drive west. We are on the lookout for roos immediately. We see about 4, but they are all roadkill so far. We get to Frogs & Roses, which is a lovely restaurant, nursery, and home. We say hi to Morris, the donkey, as well as some chickens, and a bulldog. After a mediocre lime milkshake and a sage & rosemary pizza, we head on. We go to Flinders Chase, a large park at the western tip of the island. A silly ranger informs me that roos sleep during the day so gave us some things to do for a few hours before coming back to the roo zone. Onward to the century-old lighthouse and the fur seal hangout spot, Admiral's Arch. We see some fight and are able to get quite close. They smell like the zoo. We finish our picnic food and head to Remarkable Rock, which is an apt description. It looks like something Gaudi designed. We return to the visitor's center where we begin our walk. Immediately we see an echidna snuffling along. We follow him a while and, although we are right next to him, he appears to be completely unaware of us. We walk on and see many fluffy balls in the trees, which are sleepy koalas. They are all over. The we see three kangaroos feeding. Then two more. Then five off in the distance. We walk into a clearing and they are all over. Some are lying down, some are feeding, some are hopping around. The sun is low, there are geese around, and everything is beautiful. We are in a miniature world of animals and I can hardly believe it. We stroll through this for a good while and then head back to the car. When we're almost there I realize my keys are not in my pocket. After ensuring they are not on me I realize for certain that I dropped them somewhere on our 1.5km forest walk. Fuck. The sun is low in the sky. I take of my coat and start running. I explore the echidna area; nothing. I run for about ten minutes, scanning the forest floor as quickly as I can. Fuck. Just keep looking. There they are! In a spot where I stopped to shoot a roo for a few. I am so relieved. Liz and I reunite, she laughs, all is good. We drive back through the gorgeous fading sky and see many hoppers on and along the road. Into Kingscote where we eat eggplant Parmesan and drink wine at the one restaurant that is still open. To our cute hotel just down the road for a tuck in. <br><br>To the ferry and across. Our driver is lovely and teaches us about some of the local cockatoo varieties. She also recommends a nice lunch spot and winery on our way out of town called Penny's Hill. We head up there, taste some very nice wines, and eat Mediterranean dips, yummy potatoes, and a kimchi toastie. We pick up a few bottles and head to the Cube. There are many modern Victorian style nickel machines. The art on the ground floor is somewhat charming, with a Meow Wolf story-like quality, but mostly feels about 15 years out of date. The Dali stuff is pretty cool, but his paintings are definitely better. Wine tasting is included with our entrance so we do that and really enjoy the sav blanc and the dessert sav blanc, so we get those. Barossa Valley is two hours away so we start driving. For some reason maps has us go through a bunch of farms and some unpaved road, but it is absolutely gorgeous. We arrive at the B&B, nap, then chat with our host for a few before going out for \"The Best Pizza in Australia\". The place did not seem promising, however the pizzas, loaded with local German-style meats, were delicious. <br><br>Sophia made us a breakfast of fried eggs and rashers. We then proceeded to do some computer stuff and sip port for the next few hours. Over to Maggie Beer's farm for a cheese plate and some sav blanc. We attempt another place, but it turns out it's just a processing facility. We drive through many palm trees and then head to Two Hands, where we do a tasting of some strong German Shirazes. Relax for a bit. I teach Peter, Sophie's son, The Hall of the Mountain King on piano and then to Musque for dinner. We are too late to do the tasting menu so we order scallops, smoked salmon, smoked tomatoes caprese, buttermilk salad, fries, and a Tasmanian g&t. <br><br>Another breakfast and we're off. I drove for 8 hours to get us to Warrnambool, a cute town and the western tip of the Great Ocean Road. We relax for a few in the motel, then head out for Thai. We get the same thing we always get, which is Massaman Curry and Pad See Ewe. Both are delicious. We walk to the theater and watch Joker, which left us both feeling a bit let down and even a tad angry. To the hotel where we talk film theory and finish a bottle of white. <br><br>It is raining. It will all day. We hang out in Bright Bird for a few hours, drink some lovely coffee, eat a delicious shakshuka & potato hash with cauliflower puree, and do some work. To Target where Liz gets a hoodie. Drive to Childer's Cove, which is gorgeous, but very wet and windy. Next we head to cheese world where we get some yummy cheese and find a nice marble cheese plate. Down the GORD to London Bridge, Loch Ard Gorge, and the Twelve (seven left) Apostles. We wrap up the night in Apollo Bay at the GORD Brewhouse, where we have some beers, a nice meal of nachos & fish 'n chips, and sleep upstairs.<br><br>Our day is spent completing the GORD. First we do a waterfall hike. We snack on some jalapeno & honey cheddar. Up a steep hill for a Teddy's Lookout over the town and bay. We work our way up and stop by Anglesea Golf Club to do a kangaroo tour. Ian drives us through the ground of the course as we get to see scores of roo'd boys and girls hanging out on the greens. We grab another Rebel Whopper before heading into Melbourne, dropping off the car, and having some Shiraz in the hotel. A nice older man who knows a lot about Australian water infrastructure drives us to Naked for Satan, where we discovere the kitchen is closed. We walk and discover that next door is a Mexican restaurant and bar called Little Hop, which smells delicious. Five tacos, two quesadillas, four gorditas, a beer, and a sangria later we can verify that it is, in fact, very delicious. We walk over to Above Board, a super minimalist cocktail bar with lovely bartenders and excellent drinks. <br><br>Our first stop for the day is Lune, a pastry shop recently voted the best croissant is Melbourne. We have a caccio e pepe circle, a ham & cheese croissant, and a lemon curd cruffin. They are indeed superlative. We will return tomorrow. To Dangerfield where Liz finds a cute dress and earrings with eyeballs in them. To UNIQLO for socks. We take a but to Three Bags Full where we have very nice coffees, Liz gets a potato hash with beef cheek, and I order a chorizo shakshuka. We head to the hotel to relax for a bit. We finish the red from last night and walk to Gingerboy for tartare w/creme fraiche, various very good dumplings, Korean chicken wings, and cocktails. We head back to the hotel and watch The Last Jedi.<br><br>Back to Lune for a plain croissant, a ham & cheese croissant, a pan au chocolate, an almond croissant and great coffee. We walk to Holy Moly and play 27 holes of fun, wacky, spooky mini golf, and get free visors. Next we walk to Heartbreaker to fucking good, greasy pizza and weird beer: barrel aged g&t ale and a habanero & rosewater corn lager. From there we head to the airport and fly to Sydney. I meet Liz, Gabriel, and Manav in the lounge for a few, then we head to Cho-Cho San to meet Michael and Mark for a nice Japanese dinner with cocktails and an unenthused waitor lady. It is immediately awesome to see them again and it feels like everyone is having a great time. The place is shutting down, as is the whole neighborhood, so we get a cab to a nearby Texan style salloon for beer and Pina Coladas. We are all feeling tired and everyone but me has an early morning, so we hug and part ways.<br><br>I wake up, iron Liz's dress, going her for a quick bite, and see her off. I proceed to clean up, fiddle on the computer, and eventually head to Cross Eatery for a burnt cauliflower with kimchi toastie and a Wattle seed cola.",

      "Description": "At the airport McDonald's, I accidentally order only one hash brown and get very angry. I realize how dumb I am being and stop. We fly on a plane and ride on two buses. Then we are at Izumo-Taisha, which is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. Liz informs me that the Japanese word for October translates roughly to 'without gods'. It is called that because in October all of the Shinto gods in Japan leave their shrines and come to Izumo-Taisha to hang out. Liz finds a beautiful little frog. Then she finds a praying mantis on the main shrine gate. Then she finds a beautiful beetle on a sign post. Were these creatures the gods in earthly forms? Yes. Now we walk in the sun and arrive at Tanakaya, a quaint restaurant which serves homemade soba in the Izumo style. They process the buckwheat with the hull included, this making the noodles darker, coarser, and earthier. The noodles are served on three trays, each with a different topping (foam, daikon, egg). Our server brings us a pot of pasta water, serves us a cup, and pours a splash of dashi in it. We get on a bus and ride through the windy mountains to the edge of the peninsula. There is another nice old shrine there so we get out and explore it. Older people here talk to us as though we speak the language. It is quite charming. We start walking towards the ocean, but Liz sees a cat, then two more, then two more. She approaches slowly. They are sunning and cleaning; they don't run off. We spend the next half hour sitting in the street playing with some sweet babes. The cheeky boy is especially fond of Liz. He climbs into her lap, she cradles him, and they fall in love. We walk up the mountain. Small shops are selling beautiful sea shells and blowfish with googly-eyes attached. I very nearly step on a praying mantis. We get to the lighthouse. It is white brick against a white sky. We walk along a cliff and lean out over rough, foamy, emerald ocean. We bus back to town. Liz has a headache and sleeps. I work on my resume. Two hours later we get up and head to Taste, a Brooklyn inspired restaurant. The tiny room is full, but the owner comes out and constructs a table out of saw horses for us in the parking lot. Craft beer, potato salad, fried olives, mushroom and duck salad, tuna tartar. Liz drops a piece of tuna on the ground. I consciously turn around for a few seconds. It is gone. I'm still hungry so we get chicken wings. Liz is messaging with Kyle, who informs her that he and his friend were just nearly victims of a hate crime stabbing. He is fine, but we are shaken. Walking home, we stop into a conbini and get ice cream. Liz's is rich milk. Mine is sweet potato and comes in a cardboard-like cone, which quite closely resembles the look and feel of a sweet potato.<br><br>We sleep until 9:50. Checkout is at 10:00. I shave in the lobby bathroom. We walk down the canal. An old man looks at us, tells us something, and flaps his arms behind his back. He points behind a low bridge. Below the bridge is a large, white crane. It is feeding on small fish and is majestic in the shade. Into a cafe next door. The wood is dark from years of wear, the furniture is post-war. There are huge potted plants in concrete. Liz says it smells like her grandparents' house when Hans was alive. We eat gratin, fish, and chicken. I nearly fall asleep at the table. We had intended to go to a nearby onsen town, but the bus ride costly, so we opt to go bowling instead. The building looks nearly abandoned. There are only squat toilets. The lanes are very oily and on my first throw I slip and bang my knee on the wood. I focus on my form and center of gravity. Liz and I tie the first game at 109. We both beat our scores in the second game with Liz at 120 and me at 137, which is likely my personal best. I rent ping pong paddles and look for Liz. I find her at a slot machine in the kids arcade. She wins two of three games. I eat a not-good melon pan at the airport and I fly home. Liz doesn't make the first flight, so she watches The Handmaid's Tale for three hours at the airport.",

      "Description": "We have sushi from a plastic tray in the airport. We land outside of Osaka and take the monorail to the Expo '70 Park. We have tickets to see the newly reopened interior of the Tower of the Sun. The inside features a zig-zagging staircase, which works its way up around the Tree of Life, which is more like and upturned root upon which are mounted animatronic (not operating, unfortunately) plaster creatures. From low to high they are meant to represent the progress of evolution of life on Earth. The gorilla's head is missing, leaving behind only hydraulic pumps and metal jaws. We take two trains and a bus to Ryoanji temple. It is very cool, green, and mossy. We take off our shoes and walk on soft, old wood. There is a rock feature where six large rocks are surrounded by a pond of beautifully raked pebbles. We wander the complex and find a seven-legged spider constructing a scribbly web. We get a sparkling apple and jelly drink and get on a very crowded bus heading for the center of town. We go by Kichi Kichi Omurice, not expecting to get in, but are let in. We order the classic Omurice and a beef stew. The man with purple hair puts on a fun show of making the rice. It is all yummy and we eat it very quickly. We take a bus to a food hall, where we find The Roots of All Evil - Little Evil: celery gin, black Sambuca, plum wine. Ghost Note: gin, absinthe, bonito, matcha, grapefruit, honey. Liz sees the bartender drink from the mixing spoon multiple times. We have a mediocre donut and bus back north. We head to nokishika711 gin and cocktail labo for: Fungus Negroni: Shitake gin, amaro, sake, shoyu, umami bitters, fermented mushroom; The Roots: gin (burdock, cardamom, coriander, cinnamon), fermented burdock bitters, ginger ale, rosemary, ginger shoot, cucumber. The drinks are great. We walk back through the touristy area. A young guy is covering Tears in Heaven. Not far a way is a man in an fold-open van wearing a duck hat, singing with a duck toy in his mouth, and entertaining a good crowd. His van says He is Starduck Tony.<br><br>We check our of hotel #1. We walk to Koe donuts for a wasanbon and a pistachio cake donut. We continue to a nice little shop for cold brew. Northward to Aoonigiri for salmon & salmon roe, curry chicken, miso & negi, and tofu & bonito onigiri sets. The owner has a monk-like quality and the restaurant feels sacred and hushed. Next we get on a cute train, with outward facing seats, up to the mountains. We arrive at Kurama, a Tengu-inspired mountain shrine hike. We hike up in gorgeous cool weather. We hike down in the rain. We learn that Liz's rain jacket isn't actually all that water resistant. We get back to the hotel and change into what warm clothes we have. After a while we get up and walk to Cocina Órale for margaritas, chips & salsa, nachos and delicious tacos. We walk just a couple of minutes and return to nokishika711 for Soil & Pimp Sessions: burdock gin, black soybean bitters, whisky, tonic, herbs, soil. Silly Symphony: porcini gin, chestnut, yogurt, soda, fermented mushroom, honey, egg white, chocolate. Fly Me to the Moon: spice gin, Suze, sake, ginseng bitters, moon candy, pumpkin flake.",

      "Description": "At 9:30 we get a call from the from desk to remind us that breakfast is closing soon. We eat. It is surprisingly good. I meditate for the first time in a few days. I fantasize about sex as a distraction from the discomfort of stillness. Our driver from last night takes us to My Son. Back-lit cattails beard rust brick rubble piles. This is a nursing home for retired buildings. Moss liver spots. The beings lean to one side. Many require support to sit upright. Some show obvious cosmetic work. All are thinning on top. Tufts of shrubbery grow from strange new nooks. They are very old. They exist now only to remind us of how life used to be. I am briefly tempted to kick one. It is cloudy, we are sweaty. There are loud, unfamiliar insects. I can hear gongs and drums in the distance. When I get to where I think the sound originated, there is nothing there. We hydrate and leave. We are dropped right into Hoi An Old Town. The sun is setting and there are hundreds of cloth lanterns out. We hit the food stalls. Banana pancake with Nutella. Vietnamese pizza, unsure what it was exactly. Sticky rice banana. We sit at a street-side cafe and have beers. A young girl tries to sell us lanterns, two times. She is very adorable and Liz decides to give her a couple of dollars. She hugs Liz and kisses her on the cheek. Liz looks ready to cry. We are very sticky and decide to have a Banh Mi and call it a night.<br><br>At breakfast a kind woman makes me a very strong coffee and gives another man the waffle I made. We take the shuttle to Old Town. The sky is old dishwasher and it's being wrung out over the whole of the region today. We find a Banh My stand with a long line and get it. They put at three different sauce spreads and four different types of meat on this. The bread is very french and newborn. It is the best thing we've eaten in Vietnam. There are so many flavors at once and interesting changes from bite to bite. I can't comprehend it, but I love it. We walk through miniature lakes and rivers. We wade upstream and find a spa. We get decent foot massages. My hairy legs need about 300% more oil than Liz's. I meditate in the car on the way to Da Nang. Get to the hotel and relaxed. We look for the hot tub, but there isn't one. It's still quite rainy out and we are feeling a recuperative type of night so we touch good and get Indian. The lamb korma is the best I've ever tasted and the chicken Tikka Masala is unique and delicious.<br><br>We finish the delicious curry cold then top it off with a mediocre hotel buffet. Hai picks us up and drives us to Ba Na Hills, a Vietnam Disneyland. He plays techno at a soft volume. We ride a very long cable car and arrive. We spend the next few hours exploring Medieval Square, Buddhism World, Big Hands Bridge, and Jules Verne Arcade. I am slightly disappointed at the absence of a Communism Cafe or Viet-Cong Village. We ride a two-person roller coaster. We eat Vietnamese doughnut balls, a sausage on a stick, and a strawberry smoothie. We wander a lot and head to the arcade. We play a Crusin' USA type game and basketball game, which Liz does exceptionally well at. Back to the hotel for a nap. We wake and get a ride to Hải Sản Đà Nẵng Nhà hàng Bé Mặn, a point-to-your-dinner seafood hall, which appears to be quite popular with the locals. We get eight chili garlic shrimp, two big blue langoustines, ten green sauce oysters, Morning Glory, fried rice, and some beers. Afterward, we walk down the beach. There are many little crabs running around. I manage to chase one who runs sideways with his pincers up. We come back and watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.<br><br>Breakfast and face masks, so-so massages, more superlative Indian, and then we head to the airport. We fly there to HCMC, but on the flight Liz starts feeling unwell. We land and she goes to the bathroom for a while. She has diarrhea, is vomiting and is having intense stomach pains, which increase in severity. She lies on a bench in the Departure terminal. We decide not to to fly to Tokyo tonight. We decide to get a cab and a hotel, but she can't even stand up to walk to the car pickup. Eventually she is able to walk and we decide to go to the hospital. We get a ride and go in the local hospital first. It is pretty depressing and no one speaks English. I try filling out a form in Vietnamese. A man wearing only pants runs out yelling in pain. I see hospital beds with blood stains on them. One of the staff manages to tell me that the international clinic is actually the next building over. We go there and it is a much nicer experience immediately. A doctor very quickly diagnoses Liz as having food poisoning and prescribes her some pain and nausea medication. She comes out to the lobby where I am waiting with our bags, but he quickly calls her back again. I wait for about 40 minutes. I hear the occasional yelp of pain. She is the only person in there and I begin to worry. I eventually inquire as to what is happening. Apparently they gave Liz a cot to lie on. I find her sleeping there, but still in a lot of pain. Soon she gets up and we get a ride to a cheap airport hotel.<br><br>I walk to get water, Pocari Sweat, and McDonald's. She seems to be feeling considerably better and eats all of her food. She sleeps more and I meditate and look for jobs. We watch The King of Comedy and Shock Treatment, which make for a pretty fun double feature. On the plane I watch Inside Out and cry deeply.",

      "Description": "Getting here seemed unnecessarily stressful. I felt slighted when the bus driver charged me double fare to account for my suitcase. Realizing that the cost of two fares combined totaled about $.50 helped, a little. Traffic is chaotic. Motorcycles appear as cells in a large amoeba. Lots of coughing and hacking. The bus is clean. The driver takes off his shoes before getting into his chair. An old man is meditating in the median of a busy street. Couples are playing badminton in the park. The air is hazy like Santorini. People wear loose-fitting face masks and helmets. I stop on a bridge and record the sound of mostly motorcycles. I get in, meet Cori, and catch up. We are both quite tired so we sleep. Hours later we are up. I grab a bitter, unsweetened coffee and spicy nori from 7/11. We chat a bit, talk with Sean, and go for a walk. It is pouring, but completely dies off in less than two minutes. Our first stop is Tung I'm Hungry for Pho Kho Ga. The noodles are dry. The woman who served them pours many condiments on top and mixes them all together. It is sweet, spicy, peanuty, and herbaceous. There is also a meat-stock soup. We talk about The Spell of the Sensuous, a few other books, and single-celled organisms. We walk again for a while. We arrive at Workshop, a Third Wave shop, and have a local espresso latte. It's complex and reminds me of going down on a woman. V60, passion fruit cheesecake, and pumpkin roll round it off. Young cats hang out on a motorcycle. We slowly wander back. I mediate and Cori stretches. Liz arrives. We all catch up and eat English chocolate. We get a ride to Hum, which is a vegetarian restaurant owned by the same people who run Uu Dam Chay in Hanoi. We eat loads of delicious veggies, pecan fried rice, panang tofu pucks, young banana, and doughnut balls. We wander the streets looking for either a massage or a bar. We eventually settle on Below Whisky Den. There is a group of 8 people clapping loudly and in poor sync with TLC's Waterfalls. We order and drink some very good stuff. Mine is whiskey forward and delicious. Liz's tastes like Cold Stone Cake Batter™ ice cream. A guy from the Bronx plays a set of covers ranging from Johnny Cash for Jeff Buckley. He sounds good and blesses us. We are very tired.<br><br>Liz has a headache. Cori is working. I read some Douglas Adams and eat nori. I go for a walk, wander through a local market. The colors, lighting, angles, smells, and sounds overwhelm me. Raw meat is being chopped on a counter. A woman is gutting a fish. Shrimp in a bowl of water. A big rat scurrying in the dim light. Stacks of packages I can not understand. I buy coconut, which a master drains and de-meats into a bag in seconds. It starts to rain. It starts to pour. I stand in the shop and listen to it. Back. Liz is up and feeling slightly better. We eat coconut. The three of us head back out to the market. I see a woman cooking something that looks like a bright green pancake. We get one, it is coconut and pandan and delicious. We also get a fried plantain and some other fried ball. We walk through the market and see many beautiful vegetables and fruits. Shrimp are jumping out of baskets. Eggs coated in charcoal. Chicken feet. A pigs head. A cage packed full of chickens. Frogs tied together with plastic. We head to a stall and get a noodle soup with tomato, fish cake, snails, and a blood brick. The broth is pleasant. It was Bun Rieu. We find another fried plantain stand and have that. There is some fun workout equipment and we play on that for a bit. We walk to Workshop for more coffee and passion fruit cheesecake. Now to get feet massages, which is nice nice. We go by two different kitchenware stores and find some salt dishes and chopsticks. Liz found a place that looks promising called Racha, so we head there for dinner. We order some great cocktails. For food we get: charcoal tempura calamari, beef mint salad, fried silken tofu, duck shiitake dumplings, wagyu gyoza, crab lemongrass wontons, spare ribs, and beef tongue with rice crackers. It is all very yummy. Back at home we play Name That Crease™ with Sean.<br><br>I wake up. It's 10:30. Liz had a headache in the night, but is feeling better now. I make a coffee and we snack on nori. Cori comes back from a workout and I improvise a song and dance for her return. We take our time and eventually head out. We get a delicious banana coconut drink. The massage place is full, but we make an appointment. Walk to My Banh Mi for chicken lemongrass with spicy garlic, and coconut pork with black pepper cream, plus a side of spring roll. A man, who we later presume is the owner, tells us about the origin of mole, Caesar salad and chimichangas. We look briefly and the Notre Dame and get a ride to the War Remnants Museum, which focuses on the destruction of the US in the war. We certainly caused a lot of it. We rush over to get very good massages from two very strong ladies. Back to the apartment where we swim with Cori, talk about gender, and head to Bed Nha Luv Tinh, a restaurant that Cori had recommended. Tofu with seafood, catfish in clay pot, beef with salt, duck skewer with sugar sticky rice, banana cake with coconut cream. We stay up late and talk about books, gender, and melatonin.<br><br>Goodbye to Cori and onto a bus for a tour. We ride with Nam, our guide, and ten other Europeans. There are many other tour groups, each is separated by culture. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Western. We get to the Cu-Chi tunnel area. We learn about tunnel building, strategy, and booby traps. People try getting into a small hole. We are taken to a shooting range where you can try firing an M-16 into a dirt hill. Many do. The climax of the tour is getting the chance to crawl through 100 meters of genuine Viet-Cong tunnel. I do. Lots of driving and then we are in Mekong. We have a big, many coursed lunch, which is better than I expected it to be. Now to a boat. The river is brown. This is right where the tiger scene happened in Apocalypse Now. It is very cloudy but there is no rain. We are turned away from a fishing village. We continue on the river and head towards a coconut candy factory where we taste and buy that. We ride a tuk-tuk through narrow concrete streets until we arrive at a performance area where a local group sings traditional Vietnamese songs and If You're Happy. I dip a piece of fruit into sugar and take a bite. It isn't sugar, it is salt. Liz was watching me and is cracking up now. Nam brings out a python and we hold it. On a small boat down where an old woman paddles us down a narrow Creek for a few minutes. Once we're out they fire up the engines and zip away. I chat with a Dutch father on the long ride back to town. At the airport. I gorge in the lounge. We arrive to Da Nang and a nice driver takes us to our hotel in Hoi An.",

      "Description": "Woke up to a beautiful view of Hyde Park and St. Mary's Cathedral. To the posh art deco lounge for a nice breakfast where I had an mishap with a tight french press plunger and sprayed hot pulpy coffee over the table and Liz. She was very chill about it. Sydney was chilly and I didn't bring any warm stuff, so we had a shopping trip to Uniqlo. Took a bus south to White Rabbit to see Hot Blood, a collection of interesting and disturbing art from China and Taiwan. Had some overpriced blue milk from Two Sis. No luck with massages. Relaxed in the hotel for a bit. Meditated. Headed up to the bar and had some Aperol spritzes and snacks. Walked to Since I Left You where we had Little Grace: Zubrowka vodka, apple, elderflower, spice, whites; Guilty Pleasure: cognac, Pimm's, cacao, bitters, spice; Chile con frijoles toasty. Next onto PS40 and had a Day of the Dead: Chartreuse, maraschino, mezcal, egg, mole; Into the Wild: macadamia washed vodka, verjus, salt baked pineapple, basil. Walked for three minutes to Uncle Ming's. We weren't feeling the vibe in there so we left before ordering. Headed to Frankie's Pizza, which had a much better vibe. Munched on some good good pizza, drank some good beer, and listened to a local band play.<br><br>Met Sok outside a station where she then drove us into the Blue Mountains for a day of exploration. Checked out the Three Sisters and hiked around there just a bit. Headed into Katoomba and tried to go to a seemingly Hobbit-themed restaurant, but we didn't feel like waiting for an hour to get in so we had a fippy chippy (fish & chips). Headed next to Wentworth Falls for some more mini hiking, bird spotting, and fall viewing. Stopped by a cute street town to wander for a few and then headed back to Sydney. Sok dropped us off and we headed to Earls Juke Joint in New Town for some delicious local sour ales. Walked a few doors down to Lentils as Anything for a pay as you can vegan Dahl and a coconut soup. Walked a little further on to Jacoby's Tiki Bar, which was charming and had delicious drinks.<br><br>Hung at the hotel for a while and finally got the wifi working on my laptop! Headed to Cross Cafe for white bean & kale soup, caramelized cauliflower and kimchi toastie, miso pumpkin, and some PS40 sodas. It was very good. Liz went back to the hotel to work and I picked up some new ear studs from a nice piercing shop. Watched some old men play giant chess in the park then came back and meditated. Had drinks and snacks with Liz in the hotel lounge. Then we cuddled for a little bit before I had to catch my flight. Got a free katsu chicken sandwich meal with my priority pass and slept for most of the flight.",

      "Description": "Had some T's Tantan vegan ramen at Narita. Flew to Fiji and together watched Fight Club, which we found remarkably relevant. Had some nice chicken with oyster sauce at the Nadi Airport--they missed a golden opportunity by not naming it Nadi by Nature--then got a taxi to the resort. Met some nice humans along the way. Sat around the lobby area for a what felt like too long while they got the room ready. We played chess on a board with no pawns. We tried to play pool, but there were too few balls and the nets had big holes. Got into the room and lied down a bit. Woke up at around 5pm. Went to the pool, but there were no towels. Walked around a bit. Sat in the lounge for some decent cocktails. Found a hot tub and did that for a bit. Came back to the room. Ordered a cheese pizza and drank a bottle of bubbles. Had some nice times.<br><br>Buffet breakfast. The steamed buns in cardamom coconut milk were yummy and texturally very non-Western. Played chess on a board where each square was as long as my foot and the queen's crown came up to the ticklish part of my thigh. I beat Liz, but gave her some helpful tips. Headed to the pool where we swam as far as the swim-up bar. Dried off in the sun, read about the formation of stars, had more bubbles, ordered a pepperoni pizza, and then chatted with Mom and Jim. Got a whirlwind explanation of their cruise in the North Sea, their road trip around the Midwest, and Danny's memorial service in Middletown, CA. Just missed the sunset. To the infinity pool and more hot tub. Got smart looking. Had a local bitter beer. Arrived at the Fish restaurant apparently too close to closing because we got glares from the kitchen staff. We received some quite good--hopefully clean--food including coconut civiche, tuna poke, seared salmon filet, and cauliflower soup. Played another game of big chess in the moonlight. I won, but not as easily as before.<br><br>Buffet again for mostly coconut stuff and fries. Someone forgot to put custard in the custard donut. Received a wildly inflated hotel bill and had to sort that out. Relaxed and read a bit. Kay #2 then took us to the airport to pick up our rental car—deep inhale—which they didn't have. They didn't have any cars. The sweet woman tried to sort it out and managed to find an eight passenger van for us, but by then Liz and I had already decided we were done with Fiji and that we'd rather spend the rest of our time somewhere else in the world. We booked some tickets to Sydney and, after dealing with some very mediocre customer service, demonstrated exemplary hedonism in the well-stocked lounge—probably our favorite part of Fiji. Then we got on a flight. I exhibited inhuman restraint by not taking the penne Bolognese with shaved Parmesan or the Hagen Das single serve ice cream cup. Got a ride to a very nice hotel and slept.",

Had some vegan sushi and also a beef rice block at the airport. Caught a bus and then a ferry to get us to Naoshima. Checked out the big red pumpkin then had some long, chewy udon. Checked into our hotel and fell asleep for a few hours. Had a nice latte and missed a bus. Took a taxi to the Honmura port and got tickets for Art House, a collection of empty homes in the area which have been made into art exhibits. #1 Ishibashi for waterfalls and burnt cliffs. #2 Haisha for statue of liberty and laquer room. Stopped by 'The Water' to dip our feet in a nice pool. #3 Gokaisho for flower petals on tatami. #4 Kadoya for LED numbers in water. Walked up to Go'o shrine for white rocks, an underground chamber, and ice stairs coming up from the underground pool, through the ground, and up the shrine. To the bubble bike parking lot and then on a bus to Benesse House Museum for some more nice art and looking at the sky. Our favorite piece there was a wall of phrases like 'play and die' and 'fuck and live' written in neon. Called a cab and got our same drive from earlier (apparently there are only two taxis on the island) and headed to Naoshima I <3 Yu public bath, but got distracted by a cute mid-century Americana diner with a great smelling grill out front and had some Cajun chicken and a tuna melt there. Had a nice bath in I <3 Yu with an elephant sculpture. Saw Buddy from the diner and chatted with him for a while. It turns out he's good friends with Elovis Sato. Walked to Bar Saru for a local rice beer and a local ginger beer, which were weird and pretty good. To our tatami room for cuddles and bed.<br><br>Had some nice coffees from Mikazukishoten. Our barista was very friendly and gave us some stickers. Took a bus to Honmura and got tickets for James Turrell's Minamidera, which is a very dark room where you sit still for 15 minutes and perceive your eyes adjusting to the soft 'light screen'. It was incredible. Popped into a glass ball mini gallery. Bus down to the Chichu Museum. Waited for a while and had an olive soda, which tasted like Sour Punch rope. Into Chichu: The James Turrell pieces were profound. We did Open Field twice. Monet's lillies were poetic and De Maria's ball was heavy. Walked down to Lee Ufan for some serious minimalism and then caught a bus to Miyanora. Took the ferry and then a train to central Okayama. Went to The Coffee Bar for coffee, nice ginger ale, and a partially frozen creme brulee. Relaxed in the hotel a bit before heading out. Walked to the river and looked at the beautiful black castle. Got real sweaty. We wanted to try the local style of udon and walked for a while to a place only to find it was closed for the night. Found another that looked good and went there. I had one with spicy miso and Liz had a cold one with beef, quail egg, gobo, and fried fish stick. It was all delicious. The udon was firm, chewy, and long. Got real sleepy and went to bed.",

      "Description": "Landed at the close airport and took a bus to our hotel. Rested a bit and had a nice time. Walked to a very good boba stand for an oolong with taro, milk, and boba. Took a bus up north to Shilin Market. It was quite bustling. We rediscovered the basil and egg pancakes we love last time and had one. After a bit we smelled a stinky tofu stand and saw a long line. Needless to say we got in it. The tofu was fried in cubes, with a crispy outside and a spongy center, which perfectly sopped up the funky cabbage, sweet sauce, and spicy paste also in the bag. It was incredible. Wandered a bit more and then headed back to the hotel. Napped a bit more and headed to Draft Land for drinks. All of the cocktails were on tap and we had a South Island Fizz: Kaffir gin, falernum, lime, mangosteen mats soda; English Milk Punch: brandy, dark rum, cinnamon, apple, sugar, lime. Next round was Special: chili, rum, vinegar, whey and Hop Heads: IPA, oolong vodka, sherry, and a round of truffle fries. All were delicious and cheap. Walked to Bar Mood for purple potatoes, pork spare ribs, Sweet Osmanthus Blossom: Bulleit Rye, Osmanthus syrup, Carpano Dry, lemon, egg white, smoked plum and Tyrant's Blessing: mezcal, tea syrup, basil & lemongrass syrup, lemon, grapefruit, basil. Walked back.<br><br>Chatted with Liz's family for a bit. Headed to Starbucks for caffeine. Took a bus to Yongkang and ate at our favorite soup dumpling restaurant. Had a bunch of soup dumplings plus cooked green onions, a pork roll, onion black pepper buns, and black sesame buns. Everything was incredible. Up to the contemporary art museum for some contemporary art. Back to the hotel for a shower and then across the street for massages. Mine was painful and awesome. Walked to Indulge for chicken consomme, chicken liver pate, romanesco stir fry, and pork. They accidentally brought us the wrong pork (which was not very good), and they were out of the one we wanted so we had chicken wings instead (which were also not very good). For drinks we had Imperial Honeydew Cocktail: imperial honeydew tea liquor, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, cherry, spice and Lingering Autumn: rum, Osmanthus, autumn plants, shiso. Second round was Dream Big: bourbon, sour mash, Mandarin Napoleon, amaranto, black walnut, bay leaf. Grain in Ear: tequila, mango, agave, lime, orange blossom, charcoal roasted oolong beer foam. We went back to the hotel to 'lie down for just a few' before heading out to the next bar...there was no next bar.<br><br>Did some Father's Day chatting with dads and got more massages. Liz had her feet massaged. I had cupping, which was weird, painful, and oddly relieving. Headed to Toasteria for halumi with pesto, hummus, and a grilled cheese with lemon caper aioli. It was very good. Headed to Huashan 1914 Creative Park. Got a black sugar boba latte and wandered around for a bit before heading to the airport.",

      "Description": "Made the first flight of the day, which was awesome and unexpected. Landed and took some trains for a while. Got into Karasuma station around 11 and were able to check into our apartment early...which meant we napped for a while. At 1 we headed to Hale, a vegetarian restaurant in Nishiki Market, for a yuba mushroom don set with many wonderful sides of tofu and veggies and a fermented fruit spritzer. Headed to Sou Sou and picked up a nice black and white tenugi. Walked by a shop with nice leg designs and bought matching shirts. Headed to Fushimi station and went to Vermilion for an Orangina and espresso drink. Into a moderately busy Fushimi Inari. Liz wanted to do the whole hike, on which we found some charming shrines, a few friendly nekos, a sulfur cured egg, and superlative kitsune figures. Took the train to Face House, which is a house that looks like a face. Walked to Sake Bar Yoramu, which is a small bar that serves exclusively rare and unconventional sakes. The owner was very knowledgeable and helped is to appreciate some very interesting sakes, one of which had been aged in the bottle for twenty-two years and tasted to me like a moldy french cheese. Walked home and slept for a long time.<br><br>Had a lazy morning with conbini coffee and a flan crepe. Walked to Weekenders Coffee where we had a dark roast and a light roast cold brew. Both were excellent. Took a bus to Aonigiri, which it turns out was closed. Found a local beef curry restaurant where we had a beef curry and a beef hash omurice. Began our many hours long stroll down the Path of Philosophy. We mostly skipped the bigger temples and focused on small finds, like a pretty black dragonfly, tako ni neko washi tape, cats, hydrangeas, and a mouse shrine. Back in the city we found a good and cheap antique shop where we picked up a flower vase. Onto Yasaka and then the Geisha district, which was pretty dead. Tried going for Mexican food, but it was closed so we went back to the apartment for a bit to relax. Had way too many gyoza at Chao Chao. Tried to go to a gin bar, bit it was closed. Headed to steam punky L'Escamoteur for a Death in Provence: Absinthe, lavender, lemon, sugar and a Rossi Gin Fizz: Tanqueray, absinthe, vanilla, cream, egg, citrus, sugar. Left there and had a bit of difficulty finding F.S.N., a bar run by a French guy who played old Metallica. A man at the bar complimented Liz on her 'deep voice'. The owner was sweet and chatted with us for a bit on the patio.<br><br>My tattoo peeled and we headed to Kiyomizudera. Got off the bus and saw a sign for a raclette & coffee shop, so naturally we did that. We had a smoked chicken baguette and fries, each with cheese, and two lattes. Walked up to the temple and explored there a bit. Took a bus to the north east side of town where we checked out a Daruma temple Liz had found when searching for Daruma temples. It was cool and we bought a Daruma. Got our bags and headed to the airport.",

      "Description": "Remembered Liz's birthday and gave her pack of film in a wrapper with a cute drawing on it. Got on the ferry and got the premium cabin again. Read some book and ate some food. Got off a few hours later in Wellington and hit the road. Grabbed a Macca after a few more hours and got to Whakatane at around 10. Chatted a bit and to bed. <br><br>Juanita was having some car trouble and we soon realized that we would have to take the van, whose name she informed us was Wakka Two Lips (not Tulip) up to Auckland. First we snacked on a yummy pork roast she had made and some pickles. Hit the road and made it up to Auckland in a few hours. Hung in the hotel for just a bit and then headed to Woodpecker, a Texas BBQ Asian grill. We had some delicious food including beer batter fries, frickles, tiger prawn dumplings, tempura eggplant, fermented chicken, and Korean-ish pork ribs. <br><br>Juanita said goodbye. We checked out and walked to Best Ugly Bagels. They were playing Jailbreak when we walked in and a charming man who reminded me of Miguel was shouting along. Had a Humdinger with hummus, tomato, and zaatar. We also had another Boss Hog and two maple iced coffees. It was all so good we then decided to get a King Kong, which featured a tasty caramelized banana whipped shmear and a chewy chocolate bagel. Walked to the hotel. Liz napped a bit and I drew what could be perceived as a figure masturbating to white noise...it was the first time I'd drawn in a while. Watched Dead to Me and drank a bottle of red wine. Took and Uber to mini golf to find it closed. Went instead to a different mini golf, which was right next to the hotel. The theme was military, kiwi (the bird) and dinosaurs. We both played well, but I won by one point. Walked next to Amano for dinner. Stracciatella with fig, shallot, and honeycomb. Crayfish pulsante with garlic, lemon, and dill. Pappardelle with lamb ragu, olive, pangritata. Fell asleep with the lights on. <br><br>Had a nice buffet and Liz headed to work. I hung for a bit and then treated myself to a massage for being a good driver. Found a good looking place nearby and did that. Had a nice woman work my back real good. Picked up another kombucha, which made my grand total for the trip at least a score. Went downtown and stopped by AS, a nice basics store where I bought things only in black. Bought some tickets for that night for two shows as part of the NZ Comedy Fest. Headed up to the room and proceeded to eat coconut Whittaker's and watch BlackkKlansman. Headed to BurgerFuel, which Juanita had recommended, for an American Muscle and a vegan burger. They were quite delicious. Went to Q Theatre next to see James Acaster, who is one of the best comedians I have seen in a while and had a great set. After that we headed directly to the next show (next door) for a trio of Australian comics. Michelle Braiser mixed vocal loops and had a heartfelt piece about wanting to fuck Aladdin. Demi Lardner had dogs for shoes and ate soap. Aaron Chen didn't do any of that funny business, but had plenty of his own. <br><br>Kissed my lady, went to the airport, and got another bagel.",

      "Description": "We had planned to get up early and hike around Mt. Cook, but the morning was rainy and gray. We opted instead to head to High Country Salmon, a local salmon fishery, for an Eggs Benedict and a bagel, both with salmon. They were quite good. The weather was cloudy and rainy, but we decided to try our luck with Mount Cook anyway. Headed up past the sparkling blue lake and up into the valley. We hung in the car for a while and watched some Twin Peaks. No change in the weather, but we decided to do the hour return hike anyway. It was beautiful and well worth the wet toes. Started to drive back down the mountain and, as we later found out, had our multi-rib belt snap on us. Spent the next few hours figuring out what was wrong. Had some wine and food on the side of the road and slept there for the night. <br><br>Made some 'Tow?' signs for the car, but didn't get any takers. Called Gary, the electrician and mechanic who came and picked up the van. He dropped us off at the backpackers hostel in Twizel and we hung in the lounge for a while to charge up and finish Twin Peaks. Chris, another charming local man, checked us into our room. We did some laundry, showered up, and relaxed for a while. Eventually we headed out to Ministry of Works for dinner. We had a very good burger, and a pizza with chicken, cream cheese, rosemary, apricot, and cashew. I had a nice local pale ale while Liz had first an apple crumble cider and then an apple rhubarb cider, both of which were quite good. <br><br>Checked out. Chris offered to drive us up to High Country Salmon where we started with coffee and a caramel bar and then had salmon nachos and a salmon Thai curry. It was very crowded with tour groups. Walked back to town and found some very good looking mushrooms along the way. Stopped into poppies cafe to warm up a bit and have another coffee. Stayed by the fire quite a while and had a honey banana smoothie. Found out we wouldn't be getting the car today so we booked another night at the hostel and relaxed a bit. Wrote some postcards and picked up groceries. Dinner was yogurt roasted cauliflower with pesto pasta. We were too tired to watch a movie. <br><br>The car was ready around 10:30. We got on the road then and headed through the very beautiful Lindus Pass, which featured golden rolling hills backed by craggy snow-topped mountains. Headed next to lakes Hawea and Wanaka. The glacial color was not as pronounced as it was in the Twizel area lakes, but there were some hints of emerald and jade. Made it to the Cardrona hotel next where we had popcorn squid, frickles, lamb skewers, and garlic bread. Caught sunset hitting a large mountain just as we came into view of the Wakatipu Basin with Queenstown at the far end of it. Had a quick stop in the revamped mining town, Arrowtown, just as the light was fading. Pulled into our camper spot in Queenstown just after dark. Did some grocery shopping and decided to snack and watch Picnic at Hanging Rock rather than venture into town for fish & chips. <br><br>Woke up at 6:00 and walked into town to catch our coach for our Doubtful Sound tour. Drove down Lake Wakatipu and through a very lovely glacial valley. Got off at Manapouri where we took our first boat from one end of the lake to the other. Took another coach through the steep and winding mountains to get to the tip of Doubtful Sound, where we caught our second boat. Cruised through the sound and learned much about the local history, flora, and fauna. Where the sound met the Tazman sea we stopped and said hello to the seal colony. Went back in for a bit and then turned off the engines. The captain made a vague 'no promises' about seeing something special. About a minute later we saw a stirring in the water about 200m away. We began to see fins and before long we had about fifteen bottle nose dolphin friends playing around and under the ship. They showed us their tummies. Finished the boats and did the transportation in reverse. Back in Queenstown we headed to Blue Kanu and had a local IPA and essentially a strawberry pina colada to drink. For food we had pork ribs, black pepper venison, and kung pao duck nachos. Then a ginger colada. Bed bed. <br><br>Nice wake up times. Bought some cold brew concentrate and milk and finished off the delicious cereal. Cleaned up. Walked around the downtown a bit. Liz bought a nice jade necklace for her mum. We took the gondola up the mountain and did a couple of luge rides. Hiked up the Ben Lomond trail for a bit and found some incredible mushrooms. Headed to Erik's Fish & Chips for that. Next off to Fergburger for one of those. Drove for quite a few hours, listened to some great music like Houses of the Holy, Madness, and Les Paul & Mary Ford. Camped out in the same spot outside of Christchurch that we had done about a week prior. <br><br>Sat in the sun and read. It was lovely. A chatty forest ranger and I shot the breeze a while. Back to C1espresso for another lamb empanada, more coconut milk coffees, a cheesy pastry, and a savory muffin with butter. Hit the road and drove a while. Stopped in Kaikoura upon the recommendation of a woman in Queenstown. It was pretty and the beach was very stony. Wandered there a bit, found some very smooth stones, and got back on the road. Got to our campsite just outside of Picton and nabbed the last of twelve spots. Watched The Seventh Victim, an almost shockingly bad and boring film about a satanic cult with supposed homoerotic overtones.",

      "Description": "Awoke early. Back to Best Ugly where we had a tuna melt and a chicken sandwich; both were stellar. Next we headed to the ferry terminal and took the three-hour ride to Picton, on the south island. Other than the jerk man who lied to me about his 'friends' coming so as to not have to share his seats with us, it was pretty uneventful. Landed and were immediately in awe of how beautiful everything was. It wasn't too dissimilar from the north island, but the mountains were taller and the colors were more autumnal. Started heading south first trough some mountain passes, which had the softest fog lying gently upon them, and then down the coast. After a while we pulled over to check out the beach and snack a bit. We continued our five-hour drive south. It was pretty much non-stop gorgeous. We saw many seals playing on the rocks and in the water as we drove. Liz wanted to stay in a hotel so we did that in Christchurch. Got to our room, did some sink laundry, showered, and headed to dinner at Little High, a hip food stall hall. We had some nice local beers, a vegan burger with coconut bacon, very good chips with aioli/bbq sauce, and a pizza with cauliflower cheese sauce and fried capers. Back and to bed. <br><br>Headed to C1espresso for nice coffee and a lamb empanada. Played some Monster Bash pinball afterward where Liz got a score of 51 million. Drove towards Akaroa and we stunned again by the continuous and ever developing beauty. We stopped by the side of a lake and had some snacks. A big duck greeted us and basically squacked at us until (and past) when we fed it after we were finished eating. A few times it walked on to our towel and we had to shoo it away. Drove up some lovely mountains and Skyped with Liz's parents near the summit. Down the other side and into Akaroa. Parked by French Bay and Skyped with Mom and Jim. Explored the cute, very French influenced, town for a bit. Began driving up a very steep and very beautiful mountain toward the outer coast, but soon there was signage warning against camper vans from taking that route. We stayed at the top of the hill, which overlooked Akaroa, and caught an incredible sunset. Drove back to Christchurch and went back to Little High for dinner. We had a roasted broccoli from Bacon Brothers plus a spicy pepperoni pizza and a huge poutine from the pizza place. Everything was delicious. Drove to a campground just outside of the city and called it a night. <br><br>Began driving towards Mt Sunday, a.k.a. Edoras. All went well until about 20km from the site we came upon a very bumpy gravel road. We decided to continue through it, but I was a bit worried about the van falling apart. The entire area was basically Rohan, with rolling golden hills near to us and craggy snowy peaks in the distance. Made it to the parking lot for the hike, which was almost 2km each way. We we're in awe at the beauty throughout the hike. The water we had to walk through at a few points looked as though it has just melted off of a glacier. We hiked the quaint mountain; I was surprised at how small the summit was. You could hardly fit a single hall at the top let alone a whole town. It was windy and certainly looked like it belonged in a film. I left my sunglasses at the top. On accident. Began the longish drive to Late Taroko. We pulled up to the lake just after the sun dipped below the mountains, but we had about a half an hour to walk around and appreciate the views of the lake and mountains. From there we headed to the campground near the bottom of lake Pukaki. We parked the van, got out, looked up to the sky and we were both immediately in awe at how clear the stars were. The Milky Way was clearly visible and the entire sky was full of twinkling dots. We took some silly long exposure shots. Then we had some red wine with bread, cheese, and pate. Read for a bit and then tucked in.",

      "Description": "Massage chair after landing took my money and didn't work, which resulted in the opposite of a massage. Found someone to pay me back and got it done right. Bus to Manukau where we ate Indian food in a mall. Finished the ride to Rotorua and picked up the van. Dusted off the spider webs and did some practice driving around the neighborhood a bit. It went well so we headed to Warehouse and Countdown to stock up on supplies. Then we got gas, tidied up a bit and headed to dinner. Liz found Atticus Finch, where we ate roasted cauliflower with Dahl, coconut yogurt, & coriander; roasted greens, cashew cream, preserved lemon, quinoa & cumin crisps; lamb rump, veggies, tapenade, & feta creme. Parked on the street neat Lake Rotorua and settled in for the night. It was a bit chilly, but we slept well. <br><br>Got up and went to Epicurian downtown for some coffee. Bought a sourdough baguette and some incredible cheese from a passionate Italian man from the farmers market. Drove around the lake and found a nice grassy spot for a picnic. Liz napped a bit and I read. Got to Waitomo and did the Glowworm Cave tour. It was only about an hour long, but the cave was wondrous and the worms, which are actually fungus gnat larvae, were very mesmerizing. Checked into to our camping spot for the night and relaxed a bit. Headed back to the caves for the Ruakuri Cave tour. There were only four of us plus the guide, Demi, who was very cool and informative. She was happy to let me take all the long exposure shots my heart desired; well, a reasonable amount anyway. We wandered through an expansive and stunning cave system for about two hours. We found more worms, pupa, and a fly. We met tubers. We saw some stunning limestone formations. Demi mentioned a nearby bushwalk that was great at night so after the tour finished we checked that out. Saw more glowworms, a loud waterfall, and some scary spiders. Came back to the hostel and made a dinner of beans & fried egg on toast, ramen noodles with Piri Piri tuna, the rest of our farmers market cheese, and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Showered and worked on computers for a bit before heading to bed. The temperature was perfect and the drizzle of the rain made for a lovely sleep. <br><br>Had some muesli with milk and hit the road. It was a day of much driving and a good bit of rain too. Had a Macca lunch and, eight hours or so after beginning our drive, we pulled into Wellington. Went downtown and ate dinner at Chow, a mostly vegetarian, pan-Asian restaurant, where we had some nice, though unremarkable, small plates. Headed to a marina parking lot/camp site and settled in. Watched some twin peaks. <br><br>Headed back downtown and got Best Ugly Bagels. Maple syrup iced coffee, poppy with cheese, and bacon, cheddar, egg, rocket sauce on sesame. Walked to Leeds Street Bakery to pick up some sourdough and have a salted caramel cookie. It was rainy out so we headed into Milk Crate and had an iced coffee. Got a parking ticket. Back to Milk Crate and had a hot ginger drink. Wandered the downtown area some more and killed time looking in a bookshop and a record store. We were planning on going to get tacos for lunch, but when we arrived we were not feeling enticed. We were, however, feeling quite enticed by the Malaysian pace right next door. We ordered some satay, a veggie curry, and the most incredible roti bread I've ever tasted. It was lightly salty and also sweet. It was hot and chewy, while being just a bit crispy too. Headed to Miramar peninsula for the Weta tour, which included a miniatures tour for the new Thunderbirds Are Go television show and also the Weta Cave tour, which gave a glimpse into the variety of work that Weta does. It was quite cool, though less LOTR focused than I was hoping for. We drove along the coast through the evening fog until we reached the airport. We did not have a flight, but we were hoping to see the Gollum statue in the terminal. Inside we learned that they had taken it down, but we did see Smaug's head and Gandalf riding on Gwaihir. Next we stopped at a grocery store to pick up hummus, cheese, and salami for dinner. We first parked in the same camper lot as the prior night, but I became nervous about getting a fine—we were not technically eligible to stay in that lot. As we left we saw a park ranger who I am pretty sure was checking vehicles. We tried parking along the side of the road, but it turned out to be quite a busy road and was a bit scary. In the end, we tried our luck back at the camper park and ate and slept in the car.",

      "Description": "Took a cab to the hotel and slept for a while. We were feeling uninspired and were about to eat tacos, but at the last moment we passed by a dak galbi place and opted for that. We had good kimchi, nice soup, a big tray of dak galbi with cheese and various types of rice cake, fried rice and soju. Then we headed to Alice, where we drank barley water. Amuse bouche: white wine, orange, hibiscus. Reflection: .cacao nib scotch, lapsang tincture, amaro vermouth. Teddy Picker: banana rum, cold brew, Sherry. Next door basically to Le Chamber. Hello Seoul: soju, burnt rice, egg white, cinnamon. The Botanist: Gin, butterfly pea syrup, lavender, lemon, egg white. Bed.<br><br>Had a hotel breakfast and relaxed a while. Took a bus towards Insadon, but it changed directions and we got off in a different area. Fortunately, we were right by Gwangjang market and went inside. Ate a pork pancake. Went in a restaurant where we drank Chestnut beer and had. Walked around that area a bit and got a saltef butter caramel shake from Shake Shack. Took a bus back to Gamgnam and headed to Keeper for I ____ it: Ardbeg, passion fruit, lavender, agave. Marscapone Gin Fizz: gin, cheese powder, vanilla, double cream. He also gave us a White Rabbit (named by Liz): kombucha, carrot juice, white whiskey, birch syrup. Also they gave us 'girl drink' shots on the house for posing in an Instagram photo for them. Home and Twin Peaks.<br><br>Breakfast and Twin Peaks. Changed hotels. Walked by City Hall and down the canal street until we hit Insadong. Egg cornbread. Bugolgi pretzel roll. Wandered the street and were left a bit uninspired. Tried to find good coffee, but settled on Starbucks. Took a bus to the Charles H bar. Old Crawford Punch: Jamaican rum, Cuban rum, mango, house chai, Curry leaves, clarified milk. Midnight Zombie: Caribbean rum, Genever, Calvados, passion fruit, cinnamon, lemon, dry sherry, absinthe. Headed back to the hotel and met Manav and Kartik for happy hour. Tried to find the fish stew alley, but apparently it was closed on Mondays. We did find a nice street stall where we had some rice cakes, veggie gyoza, and a chicken/onion skewer. Walked some more and came upon a fried chicken alley. Picked a place and had fried dried fish, a seafood pancake, good fried chicken and beer. The boys called it a night and we went to Marque D'Amour. The space was well designed and featured many peacock busts that blended into the ceiling decor. First we had a sweet welcome drink. Then a Soft Rain: Cocchi Americano, sherry, lime, patchouli. Dark Flowers: Diplomatico, sherry, fernet, melon. Both were quite good. From chatting to our bartender we learned he was very good at flare bartending, but that he wasn't allowed to do it here. We asked him what types of flare drinks were common he made us something called a peach crush. As we were paying, he also made us all shots of whiskey sours. Lastly, they gave us two tickets to a Picasso exhibit at a local museum. Being nice to people has its perks.<br><br>Had breakfast with Liz and then she went to work. I had trouble getting my computer online. I headed out to the market again and found the fish stew alley. After an involved process of picking all of the tiny bones out I was able to enjoy the lovely and spicy dish. Took a bus to the museum. The Cubism exhibit was pretty cool, though not very large—I was through the whole thing in a little over 20 min. Took a while getting back to the hotel, but made it in time for lounge happy hour drinks and dinner. Met Liz and her colleagues out at a chicken and beer place for Tom's going away do. It was a lot of fun and lifted my spirits after a day of some waiting and frustration. <br><br>Got up early and flew home.",

      "Description": "For a Valentine's getaway we thought we'd treat ourselves to a weekend in the onsen resort of Takaragawa. On Saturday, we awoke early, had a bit of trouble getting our JR Passes, and barely caught our train to Gunma. Made it there and then caught the ryokan shuttle bus for a winding, 45-minute drive through the mountains to the resort. Checked in and hung in our lovely room. Napped for a bit and then headed to the indoor onsen to wash. After that we walked the outdoor path to the main onsens, which were outside. There was snow all over the ground and it was actively snowing. After a couple of minutes we arrived at the onsen area, which consisted of three large pools all sat along the river. We went into the first pool. For as cold as it was outisde (about -3C), once we were in the toasty spring water we felt amazing. The pool could have easily held over 200 people, but probably only had about 20 at the moment. The outdoor pools were mixed gender. The women were all given 'bathing dresses' while the men feigned modesty by holding small towels over their appendages when they got up to walk. It began snowing more heavily, but we stayed in for quite a while to take in the view. Eventually, we heade back to the room and watched some Charlie Chaplin videos. I gave Liz some very nice chocolate I had bought the previous day in Tokyo. At 6pm we went to the ryokan restaurant for our kaiseki dinner where we were served pickles, sashimi, shrimp, tofu, salted river fish, tori nabe, broccoli & mushroom cream soup, umeboshi with apricot, and fresh fruit with whipped cream. Though it was still quite early, we were both so wiped after dinner that we went straight to bed. <br><br>Awoke and had a decent buffet breakfast. Spent the day combining snacking on chocolate and red wine, touching, watching Twin Peaks, eating ice cream, and hanging in the onsen (both indoor and outdoor). At 6pm we again went to the kaiseki restaurant for a similar meal, with slight variations in meats and preparations. This time we had mackrel, a beef nabe, and salmon sashimi. All were incredible. Finished twin peaks and slept for a bit. At around 9:30 we headed back out to the onsen (they are 24hr) for a dip in the dark. It was wonderful and we stayed out there for about an hour. <br><br>Breakfast again and checked out early to catch the bus back into town. A woman sitting behind Liz on the bus became sick and, fortunately, had a bag handy. When we got off Liz also got sick. Though it was cold and we were tired we still decided to head to Takasaki as it was on the way back and free as part of our JR pass. We did so to visit Shōrinzan Daruma-ji Temple, which is home to Daruama dolls. We visited the temple and saw many, many darumas. We bought ourselves a mid-sized white one, which makes our current collection three. From there we headed home where I made a nice dinner of fermented tomato water shrimp with a dessert of fermented banana, marscapone, and manuka honey filo wraps. It was a beautiful weekend.",

As we were walking to the castle a nice woman started chatting with us and invited us to a prayer ceremony. We politely declined and proceeded to check out the castle. Headed back to the station where we picked up some pork & shrimp dumplings and a few maki. Took a switch-backing train the rest of the way into town. Headed straight to the Hakone Open Air Museum, which we explored for a few hours. We love many of the pieces, the layout of the park, and especially the Picasso museum! Took the train one more stop to Gora and checked into the lovely Hakone Tent, which is a charming hostel/hotel. Took a dip in the private cedar onsen which felt very nice and was quite hot. Had a fruit tea in the kitchen then started walking to the brewery. On the way we saw a meowing cat in front of a conbini. We bought a can of cat food to give it, but right as we opened the can a cat grandma walked by and said hi to the cat; they proceeded to walk off together. We continued walking with the open can of food and after a minute came upon another meowing cat who seemed to appreciate the unexpected dinner. Got to the posh restaurant/brewery, had some beers with grilled shishito, crispy rice, and aburi salmon. Came back to the hotel. Had some hot sake and a great miso cream pizza. To nice Japanese women sat at our table and we chatted for a bit. Back to the room for some nice times and sleep.<br><br>Hit the onsen again, had a nice breakfast where we chatted with a French woman, and had more nice times again. Took the cable car up the mountain and then the ropeway back down. Took some very nice pictures of Fuji and got on the boat. Read some Princess Bride and got off at Motohakone. Waited a while for some yummy pastries and walked along the water. Took a bus to Hakone Yumoto. Wandered around there and bough some local citrus chu-hais. Back in Odawara, we were immediately approached by three women who seemed very interested in what we were about to do. When we said we were just heading to the grocery store, they immediately lost interest. That, couple with our prior experience with the overly kind woman led us to search online and discover that Odawara is home to a particularly aggressive sect of Buddhism. We avoided them and bought some nice veggies and a steak to take home. The end.",

      "Description": "Made a midnight standby flight from Haneda. Watched the Lego Batman movie on the plane and ate a potato omelette. Got a Grab to the Four Points and got early check in because of Liz's platinum status. Slept, made a French press, and hung a bit. Got a ride to Atlas, a very incredible bar in one of the most stunning buildings we've ever seen. It is done in an elaborate art deco style and is referred to by locals as 'The Batman Building'. We ate fries with horseradish bacon mayo; pinxos with carrot, dill, and marinated anchovies; and a lobster roll with Marie rose dressing. We drank a Nude On a Terrace: Venezuelan dark rum, Italian bittersweet liqueur, citrus, agave, hibiscus. Louis Cartier: Genever, apple cider reduction, dill vermouth, lemon, gold. Walked around the gorgeous building and visited an abstract art exhibit on the third floor. Walked outside for a few and came across an early print advertising exhibition at the library. Took a bus to Manhattan, a fancy cocktail bar. Barrel-aged Aviation: Roku, Luxardo, lemon, Tempus Fugit violettes. Switchel: Jamaican rum, Cocchi Rossa, blueberry balsamic, Ferrand Dry Curacao, Amaro Montenegro, lemon. The bartender, Sophie, was lovely and gave us a tour of of the casks and ingredients store. Then we walked for about twenty minutes to Long Beach where we had two beers, a Chinese style veggie soup, and a very spicy and delicious black pepper crab. <br><br>Had a good buffet in the hotel. Watched 2001: A Space Odyssey in the room. Finished a month old sandwich. Lazed a bit and then headed to Dapper. Had some nice cold coffees and read Harlan Ellison. Next to Amoy St hawker market. First we had prawn mee, a spicy dry noodle dish with prawn and crackling. Next we had fried kway teow, which, as far as we can tell was basically a delicious clam and sausage pad see eew. Operation Dagger's door was locked, so we headed to Native next. Sparkling sake aperitif. Peranakan: Jackfruit rum, laksa leaves, goat's milk, candlenut, gula melaka. Pineapple Arrack: Ceylon arrack, old coconuts, pineapple skin, Sri Lankan spice. Young-wi, our bartender, was especially lovely. He gave us another drink of gin and yuzu after we had finished and had another bartender give us a tour of their fermentation lab. Next we headed to Tippling Club. Crispy Myrrh: bay leaf, bourbon, sage, rum, burnt butter. Comforting: sour cream, orange blossom, fino, gin, citrus. Aphrodisiac: lemon balm, cardamom, apricot, egg, rum. Osmanthus Blossom: Osmanthus, white Shiraz, cassis, vodka, Shiraz paint. Big Mac risotto, twice. Walked up to 28 Hong Kong St. ATLiens: Genever, watermelon, mint, lemon, absinthe. Cheddar: Ocho Anejo tequila, P/X Sherry, spiced pear, Black Cow cheddar. Sous vide fries. Walked back to the hotel. On the way we passed a building where about 30 rats had made a playground in-between a wall and decorative grate which gave the viewer a similar effect as looking at an ant farm, but for rats. The wall was a well-lighted facade feature of a posh building, which made the event especially entertaining for Liz and I. A security guard came by to see why the two of us were so enthralled with this wall and also found the need to document the experience.<br><br>Chatted with Mom for a bit and had a big buffet breakfast. Checked out at 2pm and headed to the National Museum of Singapore for a Polaroid exhibit and a quick walk through the history museum. Headed to Operation Dagger where Ash treated us to a smoked banana kombucha and a taste of the Not a Margarita: pea husk, smoked agave, passion fruit vinegar, salty fingers. We ate sourdough with burnt butter, peas and ricotta on toast, and steak tartar. We drank Banana Split: coconut blossom, lacto-fermented banana, sawtooth coriander. Pork Soda: distilled 7x, roast pork belly, pineapple, apple, creamed soda. New Skin: potato skins, dill, coffee caramel, cold brew, chocolate.

      "Description": "Made it to Taipei uneventfully and headed for lunch at Din Tai Fung. We had two types of soup dumplings, a BBQ pork dish, and red tea that we're all quite good. Checked into our apartment and hung for a good while. Eventually we headed out for dinner and drinks at R&D Cocktail Lab where we ate sweet potato fries dipped in truffle cheese sauce and savory fried chicken. For drinks we had Search for Pleasure (cynar, punt y mes, lemon, orange bitters); a Hibiscus Fizz, a Hot Buttered Rum, and a hojicha Old Fashioned.<br><br>I grabbed coffee, red dragon fruit, and some pastries from the market before we hopped on the bus towards Jiufen. Got there. Wandered through adorable, crowded streets. Almost had a pot of tea, but for >$20, we thought better of it. Snacked on grilled eringi, Taiwanese sausage, tofu, and ice cream mochi. Back to town and to Yongkang Beef Noodles for the eponymous dish, which was nice and underwhelming. We were about to call it an early night, but we happened to be near Alchemy, so we went in for a drink. Milk Punch: cognac, dark rum, milk, vanilla, Angostura. Heart of Aztec: tequila, pineapple, cacao, honey, lime juice, brulee lavender buds.<br><br>Up early for a bus and train ride to Hualien. Tried our luck at finding a scooter rental place that would rent to us (most only rent to locals) and got one on our third try. It was perfect weather. We drove through town, then along a highway - with it's own scooter lane - and into Taroko Gorge. We spent a few hours cruising up into the mountains, checking out temples, and taking in the unreal sizes, shapes, and colors. Made it back into town right before sunset and caught a train back to Taipei. Liz had to work a bit so we hung at a Starbucks and then at a Mos Burger, where we had a rice bun wagyu burger. Hit the Raohe night market near Songshan and then got a ride to Ounce. Sensation: gin, marashino, lime, mint. 1864: mezcal, vermouth, aperol, campari, mole bitters, orange.<br><br>I picked up a persimmon and some delicious cherry tomatoes for breakfast. We were very lazy and took a long time to get moving. We checked out of that and into a new hotel. There we relaxed some more. We eventually headed down to Yongkang Street again and went to Jin Ji Yuan. We had a yummy pork roll, which was reminiscent of an English sausage roll. Then we had pork soup dumplings and another kind which had a shrimp on top. It was all incredible and quite cheap. We walked south and wandered around Shida night market before heading up to Smoothie House for a sugar overload in the form of a mountain of shaved ice topped with raspberry, strawberry, mango, and strawberry ice cream. It also came with a side of custard. We opted for a quiet night in and a movie, though we ended up just falling asleep.<br><br>Another lazy morning of coffee and tomatoes. Moved to a new hotel and went to Woo for lunch and cocktails. Food was a bacon cheeseburger and Buffalo wings with dill sour cream. Drinks were Fancy 75: Tanqueray, Pavan, grapes, lychee puree, lemon juice, sparkling wine. Figgy Fizz: housemade fig bourbon, honey, teapot bitters, Thai tea soda. To Ximen. Walked a bit. Got really good 90 minute massages. Had one more brown sugar boba milk. Got our hair washed at a salon. Headed to Indulge for dinner and drinks. Food: Salted egg yolk shrimp tofu mousse. Seared seafood with sabayon. Black tea chicken consomme with beef. Chicken-liver pate with kumquat sauce and caramelized cream powder and fried rice chips & bars brith. Drink: Water & Fire in Guanziling: Snow leopard vodka, sake, yuzu, kumquat, lava tofu, Sakura salt. Dutch Martinez: Bols Genever, Manacino Rosso Amaranto, Maraschino, peanut oil, pickeled cheese. Firewood's Smelling: Bols Genever, Hendricks, witch hazel, sandalwood & smoky oil, grapefruit, rosemary, barrel aged. Tung Ting: Oolong liqueur, Mancino Secco vermouth, Suze, olive, mizu shingen mochi. Ellen, our bartender, was very sweet and informative. After our meal she gave us a tour of their basement bar. Headed back to the hotel and did a late viewing of Forbidden Planet.<br><br>Hotel breakfast and a bit of a sleep in. Went to O'Time for a syphon Guatemalan and a sea salt coffee. Wandered around Zhongshan and stumbled across a Mikeller location. We had an incredible local sour ale and a saison/lambic blend with s broccoli salad. To the airport.",

Let's see if I can manage both. <br><br>To Rueifong night market for dumplings, brown sugar boba milk, shrimp yaki, an addicting ring bottle game, watermelon milk, and a salted pork bun.<br><br>Lazy morning with French tarts and cold brew. Taro chunks in green tea. Temples on the lake. Into a dragon's mouth, out of a tiger's. Chalupa-like bread, egg, cabbage, and sweet chili sauce. More temples. Sweet, spicy, sticky roasted corn. Uber to Pier 2. Pretty sculptures and cosplay people were abound. Pet some cats and had Gong Cha boba (brown sugar pearl latte). To the food market for incredible garlic lobster, dark sauce and onion scallops, and salted grilled shrimp. Bought some massage tools. Back at the hotel we ate Pringles, drank beer, and gave massages.<br><br>Had some weird breakfast in the hotel. A woman was playing a bluesy, repetitive version of Fly Me to the Moon. Took a train to Tainan, had a boba sugar milk, and checked into our tree house hotel. Hung there a while and then headed out to explore the town. Found a place that specialized in a rice porridge with pork and shiitake. There we also had a nice dumpling soup and pork with sauteed greens. Wandered some very charming streets and found many cats, great architecture, ornate temples, and interesting street art. Headed towards Shennong Street when we passed a cafe that had many cats inside. We went in, played with some cats, had a huge rose milk tea and a creamy boba toast. They also treated us to an incredible crème brûlée cheesecake. Down Shennong where I bought a nice vegan leather wallet then headed back to the hotel for a bit. Headed to The Checkered Record Club. There was a wait so we headed to a small food stalls serving incredible danzai (noodles in broth with ground pork, shrimp, and a brown egg). Back to TCRC for a tequila, orange juice, and elderflower drink for Liz and a mezcal, umeshu, pineapple, and black pepper drink for me. Back to the hotel where Liz had a long night of work. <br><br>Liz had a work call so I wandered the city a bit in search of a danbing (tortilla egg wrap). Found an awesome one at a market right next to the hotel and brought them back for Liz. Cleaned up then headed to the station to catch a high-speed train to Taipei. I ate a yummy egg-sand from Family Mart.",

We ate a delicious beef curry pan on the plane while I read of troubles in Bree. Checked into a not-too-smoky room. Slept a while. Woke up and walked to Inasayama where we took a ropeway to the top and enjoyed a magical sunset follow by pretty glittering lights. Walked back to town and took the trolley downtown. Had a bad Singapore Sling in a charming antiquated CD (music) bar. Wandered and found a cool looking tiny bar with an eyeball on the door, but we're turned away by the trans probable racist tender. Went to a sushi place that looked nice. A lovely man and woman at the counter translated for us that we would need to wait about twenty minutes. About six minutes later they came out and apologized for taking so long, then gave us their seats and also bought us possibly the best chutoro we've ever had. On top of that we had some incredible ika, ebi, tamago, uni, aburi saba, anago, and local sake. We enjoyed it so much Liz recommend we book reservations to come back again the next night so we did. <br><br> Headed to NGS Coffee for a delicious iced chestnut latte and a hot chestnut hojicha latte. We were a bit disappointed to find our tour boat would not land on Gunkanjima because of typhoon damage, but we did the cruise anyway (as they wouldn't give us a refund). It was pretty awesome to see. Went through Glover Garden and saw a church. We had a short rest in the hotel and then took a train to Konagaicho; a small town that has fruit shaped bus stops. Saw a few of them until it got dark and took the train back to the sushi restaurant. Had a whole bunch of lovely sushi. A weird older man came in and left before too long. A sweet Japanese couple bought us an akadashi miso soup. We chatted with them a bit and, before we parted, they invited us to join them for breakfast the next morning. <br><br> Got picked up by Satoshi and Ikuko. They drove us to the port fish market for a stellar and very reasonably priced kaisendon breakfast. They dropped us off at the Peace Park where there were many tourists. We then walked to the hypocenter park where we heard school children singing to the monolith. Next to the Atonic Bomb Museum. Had another chestnut coffee from NGS Coffee then headed downtown to wander, look for neko-ni-takos, and look at a pretty bridge. At a pork bun and some delicious soup dumplings. Headed back to the bus terminal and caught one to the airport.",

Went to a gorilla themed curry restaurant and ate with forks, which was weird. Took a crowded bus to Kenrokuen - a big beautiful garden - and looked at the lovely things for a good while. Walked over to the geisha district and chatted with some Americans on the way. Saw a very cool art deco building mixed in with the geisha houses. Headed back to the hotel and grabbed some conbini food on the way. We both fell immediately asleep. Later I checked out the onsen where I sat outside (on the roof of a 14 story building) in a very hot pool and let the rain drizzle on me. It was nice. <br><br>Watched some Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and ate melted ice cream. Went to the museum, but they wouldn't let us take bags in so we said fuck it and went to a shrine where we bought some more inari statues. Next we walked through the castle and told each other how much we love each other. Headed through Oyamajinja, which had a lovely Dutch gate. We we're uninspired by the food options so we had a Princess frappuccino and another pork & mushroom sandwich from Starbucks. And headed back to the airport. We couldn't get on the first flight and had about an hour to kill so we sneakily drank sake, ate french fries, and watched more Sabrina. We are 16 year old girls from the 90's, apparently.",

Landed and took an hour long can ride into the city for $20. Checked into our hotel. We were both wiped so we napped for an hour. We were still wiped so we kept sleeping a while. Got up and went to the metro station. Took the train to Hongdae. It was a cute, lively area with interesting architecture, lots of restaurants, and many people out on the street. It felt like a much larger version of Cat Street in Harajuku. In many ways, Seoul immediately felt like a more laid back version of Tokyo. That being said, we found ourselves using the work 'brusk' often when describing interactions with the locals. We went into a beauty shop and bought many face masks and also foot masks. Walked on a bit and had nice chicken skewers from a street stall. On one street watched people play a carnival style balloon dart game, some teenage kids practicing their dance moves, and people doing street karaoke. More beauty shops, brutalist architecture, and Danish mid-century furniture. Stopped into a grill restaurant for pork tripe with belly meat and a strong, smooth soju. Then we headed to Bar d.still where I had a BCG (beet, cherry, grape) that was nice, though a little flat. Liz had a Wild Style with gin, lemon, egg white, and Galliano. Took a cheap cab back. <br><br> Took our time getting up. Ate a nice buffet breakfast. Watched some End of the F***ing World. Chatted with Scott for a few. Moved to the posh Plaza hotel after watching some Mongolian singers. They upgraded us to a very nice room. Went to the club and had some snacks. Walked through some palace grounds and visited a modern & contemporary art museum. There were some nice pieces and we mostly preferred the abstract stuff. Bought some more face masks and headed south to Maple Tree House for grapefruit soju, and Korean BBQ including: miso, kimchi, pork jowl, marinated pork collar, and a nice beef striploin. Took a bus back and went to bed. <br><br> Had breakfast in the club lounge. Hung out in the hotel for a while while Liz prepped for her meeting later in the day. We met Yeo Kwang in the lobby. He was so sweet and seemed genuinely so happy to see us. We headed to a great chicken soup restaurant where we spent the next hour catching up. The food was great, though I lost my appetite slightly when an old woman sat down beind us and proceeded to make disgusting snorting and spitting sounds for the next thirty minutes. I later asked Yeo Kwang if that was a normal behavior and he said it was definitely not! We said goodbye to Liz, grabbed a coffee, and headed towards Gyeongbokgung, the ancient royal palace. We spent a while wandering the grounds, he taught me a bit about Korean hihstory, and we discussed music therapy ideas. I saw him off and began heading back to the hotel, when I notice I was right next to the Korean Contemporary History Museum. I went in and spent the next hour and a half learning about the past 150 years in this peninsula. It was pouring when I left, but I really wanted to see the comfort women statue outside the Japan Embassy so I walked over to that. There was a guard watching the statue, to presumably discourage vandalism. I bought a few tops from Uniqlo, picked up some snacks for later, and headed back to the hotel. I quickly went up to the club for happy hour where I had some nice vegetable lasagne and taught the attendants how to make a Negroni. Liz surprised me after a few and we snacked and drank some more together. We headed back and she immediately fell asleep. <br><br> I worked on my video game for a while. Then I drank a bottle of soju and looked at abstract art. I convinced a reluctant cab driver to take me to a mediocre burger restaurant. Next I took a bus back downtown to get my bag and meet my Liz. After a quick stop in the airport club for a drink and some snacks we caught a flight and I finished Blade Runner 2049.",

      "Description": "Made a standby flight just in time to avoid the typhoon that was about to hit Tokyo. Landed and caught a bus to Ishigaki City. To the hotel and relaxed for a bit. Got up, ate a delicious burger from a stand down the street that is connected to a yakiniku restaurant, and headed to the port to catch a bus to a beach. We met a lovely, sassy woman at the info counter who informed us that it was way too late in the day to try to catch a bus to the beach and also that Ishigaki is renowned for the beef from the cattle raised there. She recommended we visit the island's oldest temple and a nearby garden, which we then did. The temple was old and the garden was serene, from the front at least. We then walked to the cute town shopping area where Liz got a pineapple popsicle and a drunk man asked me some questions. Came upon a live music and dance performance, which we watched for a few. Then we relaxed in the hotel and watched some OITNB. At one point I went to Family Mart to get a taco rice maki, Pringles, and some very delicious pineapple-shikuwasa beer.<br><br>Took our time getting up the next morning. Had some chanpuru and Blue Seal ice cream for breakfast. Checked out and caught a local bus up to Kabira Bay. Walked down to the beach. The water varied in shades from deep blue, to seafoam green, to emerald. There were a few glass-bottom boats docked along the beach which were regularly ferrying people to a nearby reef. We walked down the beach for a few minutes and found a shady spot under a steep bank. We stayed there for a few hours while we slept, read, explored the sea life, and I got sunburnt. We saw hundreds of hermit crabs, some sea cucumbers, snails, pretty blue fish, and a big starfish. Headed back up to a restaurant where we had a beef croquette, a soba dish, a beer, and then a soft serve. Wandered around the park area and then stopped by a local awamori distillery where we picked up a bottle. Caught the bus down to Fusaki Beach, which we had to walk through a resort to arrive at. The water was protected by nets and lifeguards because of the many jellyfish that live in the waters. We swam in the warm, salty undulations and lay on the beach until the sun dipped below the clouds for the evening. We then took a bus back into town, checked into our new hotel, and took showers. Walked down to Ishigaki cattle Maru, where we had some local yakiniku, hot-stone bibimbap, and sours. We had picked up some more of the pineapple-shikuwasa beers and were planning on watching more OITNB, but we were both so tired we came back and fell immediately asleep.<br><br>Woke up ten and half hours later. Had some coffee, Spam onigiri, and beers and watched an episode. Checked out and took a bus to the ANA resort hotel beach. It was quite hot and neither of us were really feeling this beach, which had many kids running around, so we caught another bus a little while later and hung at the airport instead. We ate a Spam-don and one last goya chanpuru before catching a flight back to Tokyo, where we had quite conveniently missed out on the typhoon.",

We had a nice time strolling along the river. We visited the National Museum of Art and learned about a few new Japanese artists. I listened to a wonderful street performer who sounded like a one man Sigur Ros. We actually tried Pachinko. It was very difficult to understand, our machines kept beeping and giving us error messages, and people kept trying to help us even though we were helpless. We spent ¥2,000 and it was all over in a little more than ten minutes. I don't need to do that again.",

      "Description": "Picked up early and took the long ride to the port for Bai Tu Long Bay. Went through some art and pearl shopping stops on the way. On the boat and into the bay. Took some nice photos and time lapse shots. The boat parked. Small boat to kayaking, swimming, and beach area. It was a very small beach that had a lot of people on it and was quite littered. They were very strict about exactly where we could kayak, which was only the route from the pickup area to the beach. Back to boat for tea, relaxing, and dinner. Many nice Vietnamese dishes. Liz completed a Vietnamese wood puzzle and we unsuccessfully tried squid fishing.<br><br>It was a rainy morning. We, as a group, decided to skip early kayaking for more time exploring the bay. Switched to the day boat. Played Vietnamese cards inside as we headed towards the floating fishing village. The village was a an area on the water protected by steep rocks on all sides. We switched to a bamboo row boat and explored the nearly deserted village. It was quiet, drizzly, and serene. Under an natural rock arch and then back to the day boat. Lunch with nice fried pork rolls. New folks on the big boat and the same kayaking beach trip as the prior day. Drank tea with a nice sunset. Ate a many course dinner. Sim (a 20-ish local woman who worked on the boat) was very charming and very committed to making karaoke happen. We finally got someone's phone to connect to the PA and I sang All Star to a few Australian families and the Vietnamese crew. It was a bit odd, but there was nothing else to do on the boat so people seemed content to keep it going. Some of the kids braved the crowd and sang a few songs I didn't know. Hua (our tour guide) and I sang Top of the World and we called it a night.<br><br>Woke up to the kids doing loud karaoke. Checkout of rooms. Cave island tour. Vegetable flower demonstration and spring roll making. Lunch on the boat and then drove back to Hanoi.",

To the pork shop, Umibudo, for Tonkotsu ramen, pork cakes, and beers. Walked to the street market. Bought black sugar Pretz. Visited a few shops. Went in salt shop where we tasted many salts and sprinkled many salts on soft serve. Napped. Liz had a headache. I drank Awamori with David in the hotel reception. Out. The taco shop was closed. But we found another Mexican place, which ended up being perfect — Borrachos. The staff had tattoos and we had margaritas, chips and salsa, shrimp quesadilla, goat tacos, taco rice, and a chicken quesadilla. Met a kind ojiisan, a well known local musician, and a news anchor. We we're tasting very hot sauce straight. I poured out too much on a plate. The musician proceed to take the plate around the restaurant and feed the very hot sauce to anyone who would accept, which was pretty much everyone. People were hilarious and had very over the top Japanese reactions. Eventually the kitchen staff came out and confiscated the hot sauce plate from him probably due to fears of the many health code violations being broken. We were all drunk.<br><br>Woke up still drunk. To the ferry that would take us to Tokashiki. Though it was a large boat the sea was rough and it rocked heavily throughout the journey. Got to the island and we rented a car. We drove by a mass suicide site. There was a plaque detailing the absolutely devastating suicides of entire families who huddled around grenades and strangled themselves with torn cloth in fear of what the American soldiers would do to them when they invaded. We cruised the island and found an observation spot. We peered through some unfocused binoculars. We then fad taco rice and a karaage bowl and saw many cats in a small town. To the beach. I stubbed my toe very badly. We slept a bit. Some guys were filming a music video right next to us. Had some Blue Seal ice cream. To the bottom of the island and back up. Took a speed boat back to Naha. Took Showers. To Sam's Maui for tiki drinks (with take home mugs), and teppanyaki surf & turf. <br><br>Got a car and drove north. Arrived in Nago and had a local pork soba. Hotel relax. To the big aquarium where we saw starfish, cute fugu, tiny eels, a very big tank, two whale sharks, manta rays, and tuna. Dinner at the Izakaya next to the hotel. Had some Goya Chanpuru and yummy fried squid. Got some beers from the conbini and drank on the beach until late. Liz and David both got quite drunk. At 3am Liz and I decided to head back, but David wanted to stay up and go and meet the people whose voices we were hearing across the bay. He hung out with them for a while and then got lost coming back and took 2.5 hrs to find the hotel. <br><br>Up very late, 4pm late. To a cute island. Ate some soft serve. Found a dead fugu on the beach. Watched a pretty sunset. To Heart Rock just as it got dark. Back to the hotel. They fell asleep at 8. At midnight I ordered Dominos for everyone and we watched some Ugly Delicious about pizza.<br><br>Slept past the hotel breakfast time so we ate at Family Mart. Down to the central part of the island. To a fish market for lunch. Then to some very old castle ruins. To Ikea island. There were hard waves and the water was chilly so we took a nap on the beach. To a cute vintage car motel. Dinner at King Taco for delicious tacos and taco rice. To a pool hall for some pool. Had some drinks on the balcony. <br><br>Coffee and Okinawan donuts for breakfast and then to American Village. Had onigiri Spam tacos. Up north. Beach nap on a concrete slab. Visited the cape lighthouse. Had shaved ice. Another nap. Ate King Tacos again. Went bowling. <br><br>Donuts and coffee again. Explored the pottery street. There were many lovely shops, but Okinawan style pottery isn't really our thing. Back to the food stall court for very spicy Tonkotsu ramen and karaage. To the airport. Slept on the flight to Hiroshima.",

      "Description": "Our plane was running late for layover in Shanghai. We barely made it on the second leg, but our bags did not. To Male. They had no record of where our bags were. To the hotel. Sleep. <br><br>Still no bags. Hotel English breakfast. Downtown. Clothes shopping. Meraki coffee roasters for great coffee. Took a boat to airport and then one to Maafushi. Hotel check in. Lunch at Harbor Cafe for daal, prawns, grilled cheese rolls, banana shake and ginger beer. Wandered the cute, small island. Bought more clothes. Watched the sunset. Early sleep. <br><br>Still no bags. Skyped Mom. Had the hotel buffet. Went on a reef snorkeling excursion. Stop 1: lots of dead coral, some bits with color, and a few pretty fish. Stop 2: turtles, more dead coral, and beautiful neon fish. Stop 3: one hundred dolphins, some of which did tricks for us and surfed our wake. Stop 4: lunch on a desert island. Stop 5: more coral, starfish, and clownfish. Back to the hotel. Rested. Gelato. Dinner in a nice restaurant on the island: coconut risotto, grilled seafood. Watched Old Boy. <br><br>Finally received luggage. Left Maafushi change boats in Male. Had a hot walk between ferry terminals. Another boat to Villingili. Early check-in. Liz was overheated and needed to sleep. Wandered the town. Had a hotel lunch of pizza & orange cake. Wandered more of the town. Saw some cute cats, big bats, and a pretty sunset. Slept. Midnight wake up and had some more orange cake. <br><br>Hotel breakfast. Boat to Male. Had more excellent coffee at Meraki. To the airport and then to the Sheraton owned island. Had a golf cart tour of the island and then were taken to our lovely private cabana. Skinny dipped in our private pool. To the club lounge for snacks/dinner. Early bed. <br><br>Liz woke up early for a Skype Japanese lesson. I watched the sunrise and took some photos. There was a huge and incredible breakfast buffet with many exotic fruits. Relaxed a bit. Walked around for a while and had a chicken tikka quesadilla. Played tennis with Liz. Had another private swim. Back to the club for drinks and pool. To the Thai restaurant for dinner. They were hotel prices, but the food was great. Watched Inland Empire, which was weird of course. <br><br>Buffet again and then went to paddle board and snorkel in the hotel bay. Saw a few sharks. Stuck around for the shark feeding. Club snacks dinner again. Went to the other ‘club’ to hear a cover band and eat some pork ribs. <br><br>Buffet. Played pool then some ping pong. More skinny dipping. There was a quick, intense storm. Boat to the airport. Had Burger King with a surprisingly nice veggie patty. Flight so Shanghai.",

Found a gastro pub and had nice beers, pizza, and caramelized onions. Got to Arashiyama too late. The lady from the hostel gave me a hard time. <br><br>It was an utterly beautiful morning. Enjoyed Arashiyama for a few hours. Did a nice shrine with many colorful trees, a pond, and a garden right off the main street. Down to the water for unreal sights and colors. Eventually headed to Inari station. I didn't do that shrine, but went for a nice cortado nearby and met some lovely Australian women. Walked up to Tofukuji with loads of people and many areas to explore. Bought a tiny plate and took loads of incredible photos. Caught the sunset only through the lights in the leaves. To Osaka. Ate yakiniku. Slept in hostel.",

To Speak Low for Christmas eggnog, hot buttered rum, absinthe, clarified milk punch, lotus chips, and a spicy tuna roll. Next to Constellation Bar for a hanky panky and a silk stockings. Found a sweetie street cat who was a pretty dirty and wanted some love. A lovely French woman walking by put out her cigarette, picked up the cutie, cuddled her, and then decided to adopt that purr baby right there. Lastly to Union Trading Company for a parmesan foam clarified milk punch and truffle fondue fries. Dumb cabs would not stop for us so we walked home.",

We bought two and set them off in the middle of the fun. Walked down to the river river and set off our floaters. Some people just a little ways down stream were collecting them. Wandered around. Mexican restaurant attempt, but it closed early. Instead we found a street food area with many carts. We had some great satay, pad see ew, and banana chocolate roti. Bed. <br><br>Nice fruit muesli. Worked a while. Back to the Mexican restaurant for cold brew, tacos, and quesadilla. To the town center. We got massages. Walked to the street night market. Bought Barb a singing bowl. Had a massive and incredible bowl of Tom Yum for a couple of bucks. The guy was about to close up for the night so he put in a bunch of extra jumbo prawns and scallops. It was the best Tom Yum of my life.<br><br>Picked up by the elephant bus for elephant day. To the elephant conservatory and saw OLIPHANTS...I mean elephants. There were six I think and they were all adorable. First we fed them buckets of sugarcane. We were able to pet them and even touch their tongues while feeding them. Took them on a walk up through the woods where they ate so many trees. We walked right alongside them and at times felt as though we may get trampled. Had a nice massaman curry lunch at the building. Walked the elephants to the river. I wasn't looking and rammed a rusty piece of barbed wire into the side of my calf. Liz got in the river and played with them. They were being silly and the smaller ones were jumping on each other. Back to the city and then the airport.",

Had a nice, fresh strawberry milkshake. Wandered the night market. I bought some pants. To a pool bar. The people in there were pretty weird. There was an older white guy who was 'DJing' by blasting house music videos on Youtube. Every couple of minutes he appeared to get bored with the track and would cut to a new house track. Some Thai ladies in at least their 40s would at times go up and give him a lap dance. One came up and grinded on Liz for a bit. We played another round of pool though because it and the beer were super cheap.<br><br>Ate some gross toast with margarine. To the bus station. Took a bus to white temple. It was surreal and seemed like a satire of religion, such as having a huge mural about the creation of the earth which included characters like Darth Vader and Pikachu. However, it was also an actual temple and there were local people praying inside. Had some nice pork, satay, and pad Thai. Got our bags and went back to bus station. Apparently all the busses to Chiang Mai were fully booked. We decided to find a few other tourists who had been left behind and all rented a 'taxi' together. The taxi was a pickup truck with an open camper shell on the back with bench seats 8 of us sat in. It was fun and scary and dusty. We picked up a bunch of weird snacks and drank warm beer as our driver drove like a madman to get us to the city.",

To Hard Rock Cafe for Dad gifts. Next to Angkor Wat Putt, an Angkor Wat themed mini golf course a man built it on his property. There are miniature replicas of many of the temples. Jeff Beck and the like were playing. We had some beers. Liz got a hole-in-one on the most difficult hole. It started pouring. We met some kind gaijin teachers. Finished our game and went back to the city. To Mama Shop for great pizza and burrata. Next to the night market for some tight pants.<br><br>Hotel breakfast. The servers were oppressively over attentive. We rented bikes and rode to the Angkor Wat ticket office. We bought tickets, but it was very hot and Liz was suffering from heat exhaustion. Returned to the hotel. Slept a while. Met Dara, a tuk tuk driver who would become our go to guy from then on out. To a family restaurant for Lol Lak, spring rolls, fish soup, a banana shake, and coffee with condensed milk. Met a cute cat. To the old market for pants and a scarf. Tuk tuk back. Relaxed and bit and got massages in a hotel room. Liz slept. I went out for dinner. I found the area with the best looking food carts and picked up fried rice and grilled chicken. Brought some back to Liz and we watched Moone Boy.<br><br>Breakfast fried rice. Dara picked us up and we commenced our Angkor tour. First to Angkor Wat. Through the bridge tunnel. Saw monkeys and pigs. To Angkor Thom. Ate at a touristy restaurant with great food. We had coconut shakes, 'spicy' sour fish soup, and pineapple chicken stir fry. To Bayon, a temple with many faces and many tourists at top. Liz still wasn't feeling well so we took a break for a little bit. Next to Preah Khan which had two moats and a very cool tree growing up through a two story building. Liz was all done. Took the tuk tuk back. She threw up in a park and then felt a bit better. Hotel sleeps. I went solo to Marum for a young coconut lime shake, a red ant beef kafir stir fry, and a tea smoked chicken dish with chinese broccoli. Brought some back for her.<br><br>5am pickup from Dara. To Angkor Wat for the sunrise. It was beautiful, but overall too cloudy for much of a sunrise. Had sweet coffees and eggs with bacon & cheese at a place Dara took us to. Next to Ta Prohm (a.k.a. the 'Tomb Raider' temple). Then to Banteay Kdei where we were hit with a sudden rain. Back to the hotel. Showered and had nice ribs and a fish paste and pork 'dip' at Viroth's. Picked up again by Dara. To Kampong Phluk floating village. It was quite pricey and our 'tour' boat was driven by boy. By a pretty village. He pulled over and we were told to get off the boat. We were then told to pay more for a different boat (a rowboat through the mangroves we would soon find out). It may have been nice, but we weren't expecting any of this sudden change and were already unhappy about paying so much for the initial tickets so we said no and got back on the first boat. It was weird and we felt pretty uncomfortable. Went by the mangroves and then to a big lake. We sat there for a few min still on the water and then went back. We couldn't find Dara at first. When we did we complained a bit to him and he seemed to feel quite bad. To Bakong, our final temple. He bought us a coconut to apologize for the bad time we had. We were very grateful and had a nice time after that. We walked around the temple for a while. The imps were cute. They followed Liz around and tried to (did) scare me. They cracked up. There was lovely live music coming from the monastery next to the temple. Back in tuk to hotel. Peed and then went to the airport.",

      "Description": "Our airplane delayed getting in. Took a car to our very luxurious hotel. There was about $100 in yen missing from my backpack that I'm pretty sure a baggage handler stole. This was the same day I lost the painting in Ubud. I was not feeling very good about myself so I meditated. This was part of the impetus for me later taking the ten-day meditation course.<br><br>Ate a fancy breakfast with many local dishes. Ate Gudeg, which was very good and is made from young unripe jackfruit stewed for several hours with palm sugar and coconut milk plus lots of spices. Went swimming in their Laura Croft-esque pool. Relaxed in the lounge for a while. Went into town an attempted a puppet show, but they were closed for a holiday. Went to an outdoor square where there were some music performances happening. Walked around market street where I bought a colorful shirt. There was a very cool band playing Radiohead to apparently nobody in the hotel lobby. We hung out for a few songs and they were very appreciative.<br><br>Another great hotel breakfast. Took an Uber to Candi Borobudur, an very cool and unique Buddhist temple complex. Got caught in the seemingly endless Ikea mall type exit. Then took a long cab ride to Candi Prambanan, another very beautiful and unique temple complex. Had a nice time there while sun went down. Afterward we ate chicken soup (which later regretted) and a cold coconut. Uber back to the hotel. Liz had headache and lay down. I hung in lounge and read a bit.<br><br>Woke up early and headed to the airport. Waited a while and snacked on fries and tempeh. After some long delays we flew to Jakarta.",

      "Description": "There were some very pushy taxi drivers at the airport. We got an Uber to Ubud and checked into our hotel.<br><br>Had rice and a banana pancake breakfast. The shower flooded. Explored Ubud. Bought kombucha and cashews. Lunch at Batan Waru for fiddleheads with coconut, tofu curry, and vegetable spring rolls. Walked some more and had coconut ice cream. To the market for sarong shopping. To Fresh spa for some reflexology. In the evening we attended a gamelan performance. It was quite polished, the music was incredible, the dancers eye and finger movements were incredibly intricate, and I was completely enamoured. Ate satay from a nice restaurant across the street for dinner.<br><br>Cold muddy coffee. I rented a scooter. They didn't even ask for ID. I did a test drive and maybe saw a wedding in Ubud. Drove with Liz. Passed some rice patties. A lovely pushy woman got us to buy postcards. Snacked on corn fritters, coconut water, and chicken curry. Walked through the lovely rice patties for a bit and then drove north to Tirta Empul. Many tourists were bathing in the water, which we read is quite contaminated. Next to Goa Gajah, the elephant cave temple. We saw a large spider. We drank a fresh coconut and met a sweet older man with red teeth. Stuck in traffic for a while. Headed to the waterfall. A cat and puppy were play fighting in the parking lot. Returned to Ubud. Back to Batan Waru for tofu, dumplings, and calamari. We also ate coconut ice cream again and then called it a night.<br><br>Ate breakfast and rented the scooter again. Had some delicious food from a local woman on the side of the road. To Tanah Lot where we walked the beach and 'cleansed' yourself at the temple. Cruised back, shower, and had massages. Saw another Gamelan performance. It wasn't as polished as the first one, but there was some phenomenal costumes and the music was top notch. Dinner was a large platter of local foods and a great turmeric drink.<br><br>Banana pancakes. I bought a painting from a man who ran a gas pump and also painted. We got facials. I then lost the painting and spent the next hour retracing my steps looking for it. My guess is it fell out of my bag and someone quickly picked it up. We had coffee and I was sad for a little while. Headed to the airport to go to Yogyakarta.",

I had coffee and salmon bagel from La Veen. Next to King's Park where I took a bushwalk botanical gardens tour. The flowers were perfect and the Bush had a very unmanicured feel in the best way. To Toastface Grillah for okay grilled cheese. Bought groceries. To the hotel.<br><br>Lazy day in hotel. Snacked in the room. Hung by the pool for a while. Liz went to a black tie — or green velvet in her case — event. I had a falafel 'burger' in the casino. Still wasn't feeling gambling.<br><br>Nice touch. La Veen again for coffee and sandwich.

I told her what I saw and she seemed a bit better. Bought a fancy chambray shirt. To the Everleigh for Cynar, Cocchi Americano, & peach bitters spritz. Then some other yummies.

Sat down at a coffee shop for a bit and then went out for American-style sushi. Rode our bikes up the hill to the Folk Museum, but it had just closed. We rode down to the east side of town and explored the shrines there until it got dark. Found a majestic cemetery hidden on a mountain behind a shrine. To a well-populated area with narrow alleys and many small restaurants. Sat down at a grill-your-own-food type restaurant that had a not very hot grill. Played a rubber throwing star game and an air rifle game they had set up in this carnival/food stall lot. We were still hungry so we walked to McDonalds and had burgers. Back to bed.<br><br>Ryokan breakfast. Again to the morning market where we had an egg/marshmallow treat and some local milk. To the Hida Folk Museum. We were treated to some very beautiful views and spent a while exploring reconstructed historic Japanese homes. Yakisoba for lunch and then took the train back to Tokyo.",

There was a woman singing on stage and many food stalls. We had melon soft serve, squid balls, and cheesy bread. Then we saw an incredible float parade (the cause for the park festival). Dozens of men were holding up large floats and literally running down the street with them. One float had a pyramid of probably 200 paper lanterns with candles inside. There was a man inside the pyramid whose job it was to literally punch out any lanterns that caught on fire as to not let the whole thing go up in flames. To the hotel. Very late night ramen in a very late night town. Many restaurants were open until 5am.<br><br>Up and transit to Kawachi Fuji Garden to see, among other things, the wisteria flower tunnel. Had pastries at the station. I hid sneaky puppy post-it notes all around for Liz to find. Many of the flowers were already dying off, but it was still beautiful and we had a nice time wandering the gardens. Conveyor belt sushi was oishii. Drank more coffee. Explored the west part of town. Hotel relax. The park was closed down. Went to Ichiran for very porky, very garlicky Tonkotsu ramen in isolation booths.<br><br>French pastry shop for breakfast. Wandered a bit more. Unctuous udon for lunch. Relax in a smaller park. Flew on an airplane.",

Hawker Chan) for chicken rice and char siew with fat noodles. Walked around Chinatown. Looked in street stalls. Visited a Hindu temple. Drank some Tiger. Even at night we were sweating.

There was a wonderful woman on stage as M.C. who we watched for some time. We stumbled into the Buddha Tooth Temple, which was dark and exotic. Walked to the Maxwell food market where we had sugarcane juice, fried banana, gyoza, and carrot cake. Wandered south of Chinatown through a hip district. Back to the hotel to rest up a bit. To Long Beach Crab. The restaurant had dozens of large tanks with crabs, lobster, fish, and clams. We ate the black pepper crab, and aubergine pot with chicken floss, and lobster fried rice. It was all incredible and very buttery. To Sugarhall, a rum bar, for great music and nice drinks.<br><br>Same place as the day before for breakfast. To the Gardens by the Bay where we explored the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome for most of the day. Headed to MTR in Little India for a nice vegetarian meal.

Then to Dapper coffee for Magic Gold Brew. I spent many hours in the National Museum where I also ate chicken wings and an ice cream sandwich. As the sun went down I explored Fort Canning Park.

It was early, but our hotel let us into our room anyway. Showered and napped. To Hong Kong Station for Tim Ho Wan (Dim Sum): pork buns, rib meat, dumplings, beef balls. The tea tasted a bit like dirt. To The Peak. Walked. There was a long line for the tram up to the peak. It was very crowded and and surprisingly mall-like at the top. It was not serene; there were crowds of people all around who didn't mind nudging. After much waiting we got a pretty nice spot up front and watched the city turn dark as the sun set. It was quite beautiful. People were crowding all over Liz and one girl pushed her head over with her selfie stick. I yelled at her for it and she was very embarrassed. She apologized to me and Liz and seemed to feel bad afterward. Back into the city. Roast goose and sweet pork soup for dinner. To Honi Honi for some nice drinks.<br><br>Headed east to a food market. Saw mostly raw foods first, but then found the cooked food area. Split a yummy roast duck. Nice coffee shop for cold brew and a smoked milk affogato. Learned about fidget spinners. To the Ladies Market. Bought a spinner, then immediately had a Baader-Meinhof for them. Got foot massages. More Ladies Market and bought a wallet. To Kowloon Park. Saw an anime statue row. Ate pan-fried soup pork buns from a Michelin recommended place. Liz bit into one, but the hot juice squirted right up her nose and burned her bad. It hurt for a few days afterward. Nonetheless, the dumplings were fantastic and we still ate them, albeit more slowly. Wandered and back. McDonalds burgers and sleep.<br><br>I forgot to tell Liz Happy Birthday. Went out around 11 to get char siu bao, har gow, pringles, and milk tea. Brought them back to Liz for breakfast in bed. Left around 3. Grabbed a quick kebab and went to the Hong Kong History Museum. Learned how the British were the worst (like starting the opium epidemic to promote trade in the region) and saw towers of bao. Japan also was terrible for quite a while. Walked around the harbor on the Kowloon side and went back to the hotel to rest up a bit.<br><br>Up and to the airport.",

The sun set while there were hundreds of birds floating on the water. To the King's Head for beer and chicken strips and a steak & ale pie. Took the train and bus back to London.",

It was heart wrenching to say the least. Beer store for beer. Fries. Visited the Sex Museum and saw a lot of dick pics...statues. Crepes. No luck at Door 74.<br><br>Three beers and crisps for breakfast. Bocca: strawberry milkshake and coffee. To the art museum to see Colored Boy and other Jordan Wolfson works, KLM, 3D printed clay vases. Junkyard (hot) Dogs lunch. Bols House tour to see how their spirits are made. One experience was a phone booth like box you enter where you stare into a mirror, drink a shot of Genever, and are treated to a minute long psychedelic light, sound, and vibration (via a shaking floor plate) show. Smelled many spices. Finished off the tour with a cocktail. Bus home.",

Emma had pasta fries. Beers at the music store/beer shop. Dark park wander. It felt like the beginning of the Warriors. Nearly played night put put. Learned about Weimar and the gay SA from Alex. Buck and Breck for Alaska: gin, Chartreuse, orange bitters and Caribbean Bar Fly: overproof rum, dark rum, Fernet, cherry brandy, Angostura.<br><br>Oily and crispy pancakes. Nicer staff. Big park. Swooping birds. Lie down in grass. Soviet memorial. Currywurst and sudden rain. Heavy rain. Really heavy rain. Done. Alex. Kebab & spicy halloumi sandwich. Beer and a walk.",

      "Description": "We were picked up by nice man and driven to our hotel in Fira. Ate some good falafel in town. There were many clubs with loud music. Went to a club called Absinthe. I ordered absinthe (on of the few there who do I'm sure) and Liz had a tropical drink. Picked up some pastries for the morning.<br><br>Ate the pastries and had coffee in the lobby while some asshole American abused the staff. We wrote a limerick about them I can't share here. To PK bar for a Bloody Mary and a Watermelon Bellini. Moved to a new hotel. Had a sleep. Got up and ate gyros at Lucky's. We both got pedis from a nice local woman. Visited a church on a hill. Ate gelato then had beer and snacks. Hotel pool hangout. Touch. Bed.<br><br>Rented an 150cc ATV. It had some trouble with hills and the trunk was zip-tied on, but it gave us the ability to tour the island in a whole new way. Had some bad pastries. To Parissa Beach. We had coffee and a cocktail. Had some chili and nice water. To the next beach. Ate at a restaurant with a great view that overcharged us for fish. Drove down some dirt roads and saw beautiful churches. To Red Beach. We hiked down to the very red beach at the bottom of a tall cliff. It looked very susceptible to a sudden landslide. Had some sugary drinks in the parking lot. Next to Akrotiri lighthouse at the end of the island. Hiked around there a bit. Did a meal at a nice restaurant where, when we drove by earlier, the woman owner gave us a big genuine wave and smile. It was an absolutely charming place where we had eggplant with garlic, baked cheese with peppers, moussaka, and homemade strawberry and chocolate ice cream bars for dessert. We bought some caper leaves and sun dried tomatoes in jars from their shop. I wish we could go back there over and over. We drove up to the highest point on the island and were treated to stunning views. Below us was a misty, fantasy world. Drove next to Pyrgos, our favorite town on the island. There were no roads here, just alleys. If M.C. Escher and Gaudi designed a town, this would be it. We saw many cats. It was basically true cat castle. Found twelve cats inside and out of one cute shop where we bought some bowls. We had baklava with ice cream. We caught the sunset as we were driving down the mountain. To Lucky's again for gyros.<br><br>Visited a magical grocery store near the hotel. It was dimly lit inside and smelled a bit stale. The meat & cheese cases looked like they were in a forest. Hardly any space was untouched. Nothing was in it's packaging. Every nook and cranny was fitted with an item. To Fira for coffee and gelato. The woman behind the counter praised us for our manners. Lucky's gyros again. I wanted to ride a donkey down to the port. Liz was not so fond of the idea, but acquiesced. It was frightening, exciting, and smelly. The port was nothing special so we took the cable car up. Napped. To Santo Winery where we hung for a few hours while doing a tasting of 18 smallish glasses of wine and more cheese than even we could eat. There was not much of a sunset due to the heavy haze, but we thoroughly enjoyed it all. A bunch of Americans flagged down a bus and got back to Fira.<br><br>ATV excursion day 2: the north half. Started with pastries, coffee, and a 300cc ATV. It was a much better machine. To a nice, but hot beach. Didn't stay long. Next beach. Ate at a quaint restaurant that took a very long time to serve us. Liz was a bit grumpy about this in addition to the fact that the food wasn't very good. We followed a tour group down to what we found out was a nude beach with beautiful views of cliffs.The group left and there were only a few folks around. I partook in the removing of clothes. Liz did not. The weather and water were great. I went swimming, but my mind was stuck on the though of sharks nipping off my favorite bits so I didn't stay out long. Drove to Ammoudi bay. There were octopodes hanging on a line. We ate tzatziki fries, grilled mussels in mustard sauce, and grilled squid. Back to Fira. More beer & Lucky's.<br><br>Rode a dizzying bus to Oia. We arrived to our freshly built, surreal-minimalist hotel. Went for a swim in the cool pool. Back to Ammoudi Bay again for a not-as-good-as-before meal. Walked up the cliff. Saw some sweet dogs and caught a crisp sunset from the steps. People clapped for it and it was pretty adorable. Had baklava and ice cream. Liz bought a ring. Picked up Olives and Cheetos from a shop and snacked on them while sitting on our balcony.<br><br>Liz woke up early to look for a kitten. No luck. Back to bed. Explored Oia a bit and had crispy pita, tzatziki, stewed beef & tomatoes, and roast lamb with onions & garlic for lunch. Back to Fira and then the airport.",

Walked to the water and took some nice photos. Snacked in room and went back to bed.<br><br>Had coffee, cereal, brown cheese, caviar from a tube, and pickles for breakfast. I was spacey. Got onto the boat, which had a sweet dog on board. Saw many pretty mountains as we began to head through the fjords. We learned about suicide birds, who apparently after losing their mate will commit suicide by diving down into the icy water. We tried to confirm this on the internet later and are not convinced it is true. Our boat began breaking up ice sheets as we entered less-frequented waters. Ate a lunch of salmon, whale, rice, salad, bread. We cruised by a massive glacier. It was the first glacier I had ever seen and I was in awe. There was too much ice out still for us to be able to go to Pyramiden, an abandoned Russian mining town, so we stayed on the boat and continued our tour. It was very cold in the boat and it was difficult to get comfortable. We passed a cabin on the land where, almost 100 years ago, a dozen men died because they were stuck there for a winter and got lead poisoning from cooking their food in the can instead of transferring them to pots. Back to land and to the hotel. We ate cheese puffs and cuddled in bed.<br><br>Same breakfast. I gave Liz a palimpsest Bel-Air birthday card.

Walked through the city then home to Omar and Kayak. They were lovely humans. I talked with Omar about Javascript and Arduino. We had fun at the grocery store and then Liz and I made asparagus pesto spaghetti and cold chocolate bulges.<br><br>For breakfast Omar made arepas with black beans, butter, and cheese as well as coffee, bacon, and meatballs. Walked a bit and looked at the lovely homes. We saw a dog bar, an orange barn, and some very black homes. To Vigelandsparken to see many interesting statues. First on bridge: Baby. Women with aliens. Angry men. Up steps. Girl w/unicorn. Maze path. More steps. Monolitten, 17 meters of bodies shaped into a monolith. There were also 36 surrounding statues which included a mother being ridden by her children, a woman with oily breasts (from people putting their hands on them), and a child on pile of children. All of the statues were nude. To Uptown. Coffee from Espresso House. Saw some adorable architecture. The city hall was beautiful and looked like brown cheese. Ran to the ferry. Toured the Fjord. Saw the shipyard, summer cottages, the ski jump, Rodruss, and a fortress. Walked by the opera house. Students were dancing out front. To parliament. Nearby was the Stonecutters Freemason building. Saw a dirty clown. To Fuglen for excellent coffee. Spicy Thai. Then homemade pizza. Hugs and goodbyes.<br><br>Breakfast smoothies. Got a view of Oslo from the 2nd tallest building. Coffee and croissants. Train. Plane. Tromsø. Svalbard.",

Some teenage boys came in and had breakfast with tea. Ben the Windy used the toilet. In the museum. Special event on the 2nd floor, we sat in for an interview with The Shapes, a punk band from Coventry in the 70's. Their stories were entertaining and they played a few songs, including Batman in the Launderette. Took photos with them and walked with a few of the band members to their car to buy a vinyl, which they signed. Great museum featuring lots of Two-tone stuff. Spoke with the parents of the lead singer from the Primitives. More used vinyl from the gift shop. Wandered the university and cathedral. Ate grapes, drank water, and and encountered some inconsiderate footballers outside of the museum. Did the Museum of Transportation. Coventry was the UK's Motor City. Very cool bicycles. They closed when we were halfway through. Ate some very Chinese food. Picked up beer and artichoke hearts from the store for our couchsurfing hosts. Met Marie & Joe. We had tea. Liz worked on their puzzle. We chatted about slugs, laundry, gender, and history. Had a cold, uncomfortable sleep on the floor.<br><br>Had a brief chat with hosts and then out. To Hampstead Cafe then the cathedral. The cathedral had been bombed in World War #2 and was rebuilt in a great way. Many diverse features w/intricate designs yet set in a humble, minimalist space. To the Grayson Perry exhibit in the Herbert Art Gallery next door. There were something like eight large tapestries there inspired by the Rake's Progress and many other works. There was also a great TV program playing where Grayson would explore people's homes. Finished off the Transport Museum. Had a beetroot chutney, beef rib ramen, and soft shell crab tempura. Train back to London.",

Took a film photobooth in a bar. It was malfunctioning and kept taking pictures of us. Wonderful! I bought two grapefruit and pretended they were my boobs. Melvin made us marzipan treats. It was cold at first, but the heater warmed up. Outside, above the cold city. I could hear birds having conversation. Sunset over the city. Liz was wearing a blanket that made her very cat like. We all did drawings. Melvin made a sweet blue milk. Ate crepes. Listened to music until the laptop died. Lights off. Turned on a star lamp. We made hand monsters in the shadows. Slumber party for a while until we finally went to our room.<br><br>Breakfast. Boca Moca. Same street market. Pin Pon for fish & chips and a lot of steak tartare. Plants. Vintage goods. Coffee. Rain. Spaghetti carbonara with egg yolk on top from Alexia. Took a family photo. Had a rooftop farewell and a revisit from my bird friend.",

Took a color photo booth in a cute shop. To North Quarter to wander a bit. To Keko Moku for toasted coconut Mai Tai and Porn Oil. To Almost Famous for grilled cheese and a great burger. Found the renaissance picture spot and recreated it. Met David, our Couchsurfing host, at the petrol station. His house was surreal and dream like. There were keys all over the floor, there was color all over the ceiling, and there were panoramas taped up on the walls. We had a beer on the floor. He took us to the old pub with a chair nailed up on the wall that he told us Roger Daltrey sat in. A guy messed up a cover of a Matchbox 20 song. To a metal pub. A nu, eyeliner goth punk band was playing and an older hair metal guru was thoroughly enjoying it. It was a good culture smash. We slept on the top bunk.<br><br>Up and into the city. To Idle Hands for pungent cold brew and mascarpone tasting paper drip. To Rudy's Pizza for Campari soda, smoked mozzarella, broccoli, & kalamata pizza, and a tomato mushroom pizza. They were fantastic. Caught some ethereal African harp, drum, and dance in the city square. The weather was perfect. Someone was feeding dozens of pigeons. To the Manchester Museum. Saw lovely boxed herbs and a pineapple vase. We controlled a robot in another room and could see send communicate with people in that room. In another room, two sentient wheelchairs seemed to be having relationship difficulties and would print messages to visitors on receipt paper. Through the gay district. A woman on the street who had blood on her forehead asked us for money. We gave her some. Two stylish women — one as Marlon Brando. The other as Mary Murphy — had a touching departure at the train station.",

It was a similar bumpy dirt road. We didn't have a choice at this point. We didn't talk much for the 10 or so minutes it took to cross the valley.

      "Description": "It was a bustling morning. We saw weathered buildings, worn paint, and fresh tourists. We listened to an accordionist on the street who wore a Tin Man funnel hat, a kick drum on his back, and hi-hat somewhere else. There was a Psalm Sunday march down the street. The priests were singing a beautiful song. Overall I feel like Catholicism in Europe is a lot more interesting and aesthetically pleasing than in America. We paid an exorbitant price for our coffee in a cute square. To our hotel. Tatiana was lovely. There were swan towels on the bed. Liz bought a Venetian leaf mask for Richard. To the famous square. Saw some gondola. Walked to Harry's Bar for coffee and a bellini. Strolled the grand canal. Had a meat and cheese dinner. Touched<br><br>Breakfast was delivered by Tatiana. Made a spritz in the room. Took a boat to Cimitero, the cemetery island. There were flowers everywhere, we took some photos, and it did not feel particularly haunted. Next to Murano. Seemingly every other shop sold glass. It was very beautiful and we bought plates for Anne and Dad & Barb. Snacked on bread, snacks and coffee in the square. Sped along. Wandered the island taking great photos and having lovely conversation with my partner. A woman hung her laundry in a beautiful rainbow pattern. We were taking photos of it when she popped her head out and smiled at us. We did our best to communicate our appreciate for her temporary decoration. Boat to Burano where the buildings were painted in lovely colors. Watched the sun go down. Ate some cheap pizza. Saw more cats. To Torcello, where we hear a lovely rendition of La Vie en Rose on accordion. Back to Venice. Nearly stole someone's bread at the grocery store on accident. Strolled the town at night and rode the canal boat.<br><br>Breakfast delivery again. Took the train to Triste. Took the tram up the mountain and got on a graffitied train to Ljubljana.",

To Mary Celeste for a delicious spritz and an Autumn Blossom. To Candelaria for a variation on a martini and something smoky and sweet for Liz. To Little Red Door for a tiki drink and a Spots and Dots. To Mabel's for more great drinks. We walked 12 miles that day.<br><br>To Fondacion for coffee and cake.

Ate a ham, egg, and cheese crepe and a Nutella crepe. To printing press letter shop #2. Walked by Moulin Rouge. To Dirty Dick for two Monkey Seeds, a Ward 69, and a Dark Shaman. They were playing Messer Chups, an excellent Russian Surf Rock band. Had a brief hang with Alvin. Ate Chinese food. To Le Syndicat for bare walls, hip hop, and great drinks, one of which included beet juice.<br><br>Took the Eurostar back.",

Went in and immediately out of a curry place because it was $25-30 for a curry. Instead we opted for good pizza and a bland kebab across the street. Had a long walk in the snow to the bonfire on the river. It was deserted, but warm. Walked just a short distance to our hostel where we met two geologists. We hit if off right away and ran out to the bonfire on the river just in time to be surrounded by mountains of fireworks all around us. We drank a bottle of Veuve Clicquot in the snow. We didn't stay out long due to the cold. Back inside we talked about cattle hydration and tectonic plates. I snored all night apparently. Sorry.<br><br>Hot dogs from Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur ('The Towns Best Sausages'), a popular hot dog stand, for a late breakfast. Went to the big church. We missed mass, but were still able to hear the incredibly beautiful organ. Didn't see the aurora. Had some great Thai noodles and then a drink in the London Underground themed Kaffibarinn. Took nice pictures. Watched Smarter Brother. <br><br>Ate delicious bagels from Kaffitar. Saw maybe too many penises at the Phallological Museum. A dog jumped on me. Ate more hot dogs from Bæjarins; these were great hot dogs. Ate fish stew, fish kebab, and a potato kebab at Sea Baron. Went on a Northern Lights tour. We didn't see any with our eyeballs, but I took many long-exposure photos with some green shades in them. Ate two more hot dogs (5.5 total for me) and slept in a room that was way too cold.

'Inside' Pompidou for lots of trite classic modern art, but also some quite good contemporary art. Saw nice view of Paris. Had expensive margaritas and great tacos at Candelaria. Alvin thought the chef dug me because he was being bickery with me. To Sherry Butt for great drinks (mine had a smoky tomato liqueur in it). Walked around the Louvre exterior and by the Seine.

There are also many stalls selling the same and also food. There is a pristine Spitfire on display. We buy milk powder for the bath. Next we stop in a pub for bitter ale and chips. Afterward we visit a small Alan Turing museum where we see an Enigma, a German enciphering machine, and the Bombe, a deciphering proto-computer he invented. Then we have a sausage with cream tea. Later, we watched couples dance to a live swing band in the tent. As evening sets in we head to Bradford. We don't feel comfortable here and we can't find condoms. We eat chicken at Nando's. There's a fight outside. A man in the lift reminds us of Dracula.<br><br>A man at the bus stop Just. Keeps. Spitting. We eat bread and salami. And then sat in the grass for a cream tea. We take the steam train north. I chat with a nice older Irish man. Liz sits next to a young boy who she says smells like sugar. His hands are sticky and he repeatedly touches her skirt. I get a cask cream ale at the station before we return to London.",

We catch a drag show at the end of the street.<br><br>Omelette and cereal. We stroll through the Garden District, grab a coffee, and explore Lafayette Cemetery No. 1.

      "Description": "One of Medellín's top attractions is a few-mile long cable car which ends at a large park. This is my first to-do. I board the car in the middle of the city, at the bottom of the valley. The car goes up the side of the mountain, over favelas, and across the hills. In thirty minutes I am at Arvi Park. I get lulo juice and grilled mushrooms from a street vendor and then proceed to wander through manicured and paved mountain trails for a couple of hours. I get some fresh fruit with yogurt from another cart vendor. On my way back, I get off at the favela station halfway down the mountain. It is festive, lively, colorful. I get looks from locals that seem to inform me this is not the place for tourists. I head to El Poblado, a place meant for tourists. I eat a bad carne fajita cone from a clean corporate fast food restaurant. I want to hear some live music. I find a group, but they are busking directly to couples on the street and mostly interested in tips. A man wearing nearly twenty stacked hats follows in their wake, hoping to capitalize off of the festive spirit the musicians bring. I find a rock cover band playing the Cranberries \"Zombie\" at a bar. I stay and have what I hope is Calamari.<br><br>Hostel breakfast and then to Plaza Botero. An older, vagrant man has a small crowd around him. I'm not sure if he is an entertainer, a preacher, or mentally ill. He takes a lit cigarette and places it into a toy gorilla's mouth. Next he makes tubes by rolling up paper. He takes out a razor blade, demonstrates that it is very sharp by slicing up pieces of newspaper with it, and then runs it along his neck and the palm of his hand. It doesn't part his skin. He then unbuttons his shirt to reveal his nipple, which is pierced with a safety pin. Hanging from the pin is a small cloth bag. He opens it, which contains a few diamond shaped black pebbles. He lifts up a cup of what looks like water with food coloring in it. He places the stones in the water. They absorb all of the color, turning the water clear. I can't read the expressions of the faces of the crowd, but none of them look as confused as I surely do. I leave. In the museum, I take in the beauty of the voluminous Botero figures. I walk to Pergamino where I have a tasty coffee and watched the fútbol game with a room of about 60 people. Colombia wins. The streets are a joyous party for the rest of the evening. Vendors are selling all sorts of noise makers, hats, and canisters filled with foam to spray. There is foam everywhere. Lots of chanting.<br><br>A 13 year-old kid drives me to the airport.

A bullfighting arena. There is a statue of a famous matador out front; he has a massive bulge. All over town people are setting up for the World Cup where tonight Colombia will play against Bolivia. It is a big deal. I buy new pants and walk to Plaza Bolivar to watch Colombia play in the cup. This plaza is packed. There is a live projection of the game onto the side of a building. It is the most enjoyable sporting experience I have ever been a part of. There are men and women with carts selling all sorts of things. I get a sweet tea and a hot dog. Someone brought a llama.<br><br>It is rainy. I eat masa y queso cake and walk to Monserrate, a mountain peak on one side of town with a curch at the top. I take the cable car up. It is cold, foggy, and majestic. I come down and head to Tabula. While drinking a Negroni at the bar, Tomas comes out to give me dining advice. I accept all of it. Nice bread with olive oil and tomato paste. Ceviche with plantain chips. Grilled pork belly. Artichoke and mozzarella soup. Meatballs. With a full belly I tour Museo del Oro before wandering markets in La Candelaria. I briefly leave the westerner area; it is neat and uncomfortable. I meet a nice American named Garrison at the bus depot. We eat some food and watch some game. We take a very long bus ride, eat some shitty convenience store food, and have a nice chat.",

To El Zocalo for cheesy, greasy, delicious Pupusas. Then to El Rio for well drinks and burlesque. I accidentally leave my phone on the BART on the way to meet Phil at Press Club, where we drink wine and smell many dried spices in a box — which are meant to help train one's wine note identification. Back at the station I talk to the station officer. We used Find My iPhone to track my device. We see that my phone is in Oakland, but moving quickly towards us. We realize that it is still on the train and is coming back our way. The train arrives at our station and the officer holds it briefly while we scour the seats.

A realtor calls me asking about my mom's house on the market. I text her, she informs me she and Fred are separating and that she is going to live at the cabin. We then find out a plane had crashed at SFO shortly after we landed and that the runway was closed. This throws a wrench into our plans of flying standby back to Phoenix that night. To Fisherman's Wharf where we meet up with Krystle and Devyn. We have some mediocre food plus beer. We explore Musée Mécanique where we play vintage arcade games and take a photo booth strip together. We are picked up by Brett and head to SFO, which has reopened, but is a mess for anyone flying standby due to all the canceled flights. Every airport within a 200 mile radius is full for all travel. We almost make it on a United flight with Brett, but there is a system glitch and they say they can't let us on even though there are open seats.

The automatics are about 3x more than the manuals, so we get a manual. Up until this point, I have basically never driven one though. I practice trying not to stall in the parking lot for quite a while and then start driving around the island. With the exception of a rough start, a few stalls, and not figuring out how to put it in reverse, I think it's going okay. We drive up and down the cost and tour the island. We stay in a hostel, but it is quiet and we get a private room. The other residents are mostly professional-aspiring surfers. We meet a lovely man from South Africa named Reese, who has been living here for three months in preparation to surf what he calls his Mecca. We have a burger in a Las Vegas themed restaurant then drive to the end of Tahiti Iti. Back to the hostel where we make coconut tuna with carrots and share with the other guests. On our way back up we stop by a water logged cave and a very old temple complex, which feels rather Mayan. Liz and I lie on the grass and watch the birds flying overhead. They have long tails which gave them a beautiful silhouette. As we are nearly back to the airport to return the car, it starts making funny sounds and smoking from the hood — later I will learn that I was not meant to be using the clutch to regulate my speed while driving. We let cool down for a few and make it back. I neglect to mention the smoke. We take a bus into town where we find a cheap hostel and wander downtown. We visit a market, a church, some pearl shops, and a cafe where we eat more raw tuna. We have a beer and coffee at a cafe. Soon we find a food truck lot and order tuna fondue, which is yummy. We also order a chow mein for breakfast.<br><br>We eat the chow mein, get on a plane home, and watch Wreck it Ralph.",

A boat takes us to the resort where we stay in an over-water bungalow. We swim a bit and relax in the bay. We touch a good bit. In the afternoon we play mini golf and go snorkeling. We take a boat to the main island for dinner at Maikai Marina: ribeye w/blue cheese sauce and tuna carpaccio.<br><br>There is an incredible breakfast buffet. We have eggs benedict, banana juice, guava jelly, and french toast. We spend today playing pool and tennis, snorkeling, eating ice cream, and having cocktails. We take a boat to the island again for dinner at St. James: raw tuna platter, steak with black truffle mash.<br><br>Great breakfast buffet again and more snorkeling. We check out and head to the main island and into a quaint B&B. We head into the town Vaitape and watch some of the Heiva celebrations. The dancing and music are incredible and unlike anything I have ever heard. There are about twenty instruments similar to ukuleles strumming very quickly. Some men percuss hollow logs. Women sing quickly and in rich harmonies. We find a seafood tent further down the beach an order a massive raw tuna plate and a shrimp curry. I am hot and I decide to cut my jeans into shorts in the toilet with a steak knife. We walk through a casino inside another tent where some children are playing roulette. An nice older man sees our interest and gives Liz a few chips, which we quickly lose. <br><br>We have a boat excursion planned for today. The first spot is a reef where we snorkel and see many colorful fish. Next is the black fin shark feeding area where we are surrounded by about 20 sharks. We stop at a deserted island for a lunch of BBQ fish, coconut ceviche, taro, tapioca, coconut bread, banana bread pudding, watermelon and grapefruit. We fill up. Next is a long ride to a sandbar with stingray. The guides show us how to grab the rays' nose and ride them. I try. After a few unsuccessful attempts, I get a hold of one and one who quickly rams my head into the side of the boat. For dinner we make a pizza and escargot.",

We quickly find a cute beachfront hostel for $10/night. The owner is a lovey man who offers some of the seafood chowder he is making. We head to a pizza restaurant for dinner.

As we are waiting on the street for our tour group to meet up, a drunk man is walking aimlessly with four cute dogs happily following his every step. First we go to Isla Tortuga where we snorkel around a big rock. The water isn't clear, but we see some interesting looking fish. Next to another small island for more snorkeling. I find an octopus curled up on a rock. I accidentally frighten it and it squirts ink at me. I decide to swim around the island. This is a stupid idea. It is quite wavy and rocky and takes about 20 minutes. When I come back around everyone is already back in the boat and waiting for me. Back to Isla Tortuga where we have pineapple, watermelon, beer, fish stew, and potatoes. We hang there a while and meet some local wildlife including a large iguana, two vultures, two little pigs, a few parrots, many crabs, and a sweet cuddly boar named Jo. A marimba band is playing Beer Barrel Polka for some folks at a nearby resort. I play some volleyball with a Quebecois couple and then we all swim in the warm water. On the ride back it rains painfully right on us. We go to a nice restaurant in town for creamy avocado pasta, nachos, and a coconut milkshake.<br><br>We hike to see a waterfall, but the river is too high so we can't get to it. We then catch a bus to take us to Liberia. Our driver leaves the door open (presumably for airflow) as he flies down the mountain at a breakneck speed to apparently make sure we catch the ferry on time. We do. Hours later we are in town. We get a bit lost looking for our hotel. It is dark, but we hear a beautiful chorus of frogs. We check into our hotel and head next door for BBQ meat. They are having a live magic show. I am surprised I am able to generally follow what is happening, but I guess magic is pretty universally understood. <br><br>One more empanada and a bus to the airport.

They then recommend a lunch spot. We are hungry and don't know anything in town, so we say okay. While we aren't quite foolish enough to fall for the Chinese tea trick (we make sure the menu had prices listed). He begins asking lots of detailed questions about our plans and recommends a booking agency for tours. We are fully aware at this point that, even in a best case scenario, he is getting kickbacks from those companies. We tell him we're not sure what we want to do and he seems annoyed. We tell him we're leaving and he says he'll check back in on us after lunch. We go the hostel and cancel our reservation. Surprisingly, they give us a full refund. We find another very cute hotel with a pool and have some tiki drinks at the bar.

It takes me a few minutes to find the keys and turn it off.<br><br>To Waimea Canyon for a view of the mountains. Back at the coase, we visit an historic Russian fort. We drive east and decide to visit a coffee plantation. I take pictures of lizards. Someone asks if I am in a (famous) band. Back in Lihue we eat BBQ ribs then continue north. We stop at a two different waterfalls and take some photos. A man is hitchhiking. We pick him an American man who has his thumb out. He is only going to the next town so we drop him off after a few. Next we visit a lighthouse and watch birds surfing the cliff winds. Onto a beach where we play Frisbee; a dog joins in. Our next stop is a gaping cave on the side of the road. We reach the literal end of the road. There is a beach here. We sit and watch the sun set. We get pizza and tiki drinks, picked up another hitchhiker, and head back to Lihue to catch a flight.",

There is a long line for the bathroom. People seem tense. We walk to 7th ave. Times Square is on 45th st, but the closest we can get is 57th st. We are in a large pen very tightly packed with people. I can see a few neon lights in the distance, 12 blocks away. Someone points out which of those lights is \"The Ball\". We mostly stand around for the next three and a half hours. It is very dark, so much so that we are able to take turns touching each other without anyone seeming to notice. At around 11, we chat with two parents and a teenage boy. They are from Colombia and are here to see the ball. The inform us that they've brought dried lentils, which are a good luck charm for the new year, and shared them with us. We put a handful in our pockets. When the clock strikes 12, we toss the lentils up in the air. The next two minutes are pure jubilant. The the crowd quickly dissipates. By 12:10 we are able to walk around a deserted Times Square. We wander the adjacent streets. A horn band is playing Auld Lang Syne. We find an Irish pub and pop in for a drink. We are tired and don't have a hotel so we hop on a train back to the airport. In the train car, a woman looking very unwell vomits into her plush white gloved hands. We sleep on the airport floor for a few hours. We get on the first flight of the morning. I get 1st class, but Liz has to fly coach because she was wearing converse.",

She doesn't think anything of it. I don't yet know when or where I will do it, just that I will. We enter the Bellagio and head towards the infamous buffet for dinner. Walking down the hall we see a crepe stand, which looks yummy, and change our plans for that instead. We wander the lobby. There is a hot-air balloon exhibit. I consider proposing here. There is a brief moment, but it is imperfect. It is gone. It needs to feel right. We walk out of the front entrance. The sun has just set. The fountains are beginning their dance. Your Song, by Elton John, comes on the speakers. It is corporate, tacky, and beautiful; a perfect Las Vegas moment. My sock slips. I ask Liz to hold my coat and bend I down. I ask her to get my phone out of my jacket pocket. She pats it and says it's not in there. \"It definitely is\". She reaches inside this time and finds a piece of paper. She pulls it out. It is a photo booth strip. 1. \"Will\". 2. \"You\". 3. \"Marry me?\". 4. Me holding a pearl necklace. She reads it and looks down at me. I am holding the necklace. \"Will you marry me?\". She comes down to my level, wraps her arms around me, and started kissing me. A few moments later she stops, looked me in the eyes, and says 'YES!'. A bit more hugging and kissing, then we hurry because we have tickets for Penn & Teller. On the way she calls her parents—who already knew—and texts a few friends. She calls Rachel. \"Michael Plunkett engaged to me...I mean we're proposed...WE'RE ENGAGED!\". The show is fantastic. Midway through the show, they call on Liz, give her a book of jokes and ask her to read one. They show that they already knew which joke she would pick from the book. No clue how. After the show, Liz finds Puppy's mouse in her purse. We stay up a few more hours, then catch a plane home.",

It drops us off about a block from the hotel, which happens to be Vancouver's equivalent of Skid Row. We are surrounded by homeless people. It is a very strange sensation. No one interacts with us. We are in a bit of a state of shock. We say nothing aloud, but we have each decided we will cancel the hotel. When we cross the last block to the hotel we find the mood suddenly changed. It is as though the large homeless community consciously decided that their area ended at that corner. The concierge reassures us that the neighbors are not a problem. We decide keep our booking and thoroughly enjoy the hotel. After relaxing a bit we walk downtown and admire a very talented roller skater/dancer.<br><br>We get up and head to Stanley Park where we rent a tandem bike. It is a bit tricky to ride at first, but we find our balance before long. After returning the bike we find some cheap sushi, which is not very good. More poutine, this time in the gay district. It is cold out so we go to the movie theater and watch Looper. We are feeling cheeky—and cold—so after Looper we sneak into see The Master. We head to Greyhound terminal early (though late at night), but it is closed. We try to sleep on the street, but it is too cold so we enter a nearby McDonalds.

To their place for a few and out to a Turkish restaurant where I had a lovely grilled whole fish. <br><br> Dad offers to let me borrow his truck for the day while he works. I accept. I drive to Lake Tahoe. Walking around, I see a brown bear and her two cubs on the side of a hill, about a hundred meters away. I watch them for a while until they disappear into the woods. I rent a kayak and paddle around Emerald Bay and to Fannette Island, where I climb to the top (it's not very high) and read a bit of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I drive around the lake. At one point I stop and decide to swim in the water. I jump in the lake, which is so cold that I become paralyzed for a few seconds. I shiver to shore and get back out. Liz arrives that evening. I have a nice guitar jam with Dad. <br><br>Up to Napa where we visit the Chandon winery and snack on some lovely charcuterie. To a casino where Barb and Dad treat us to a lovely steak dinner. Afterward we walk around the casino. A security guard comes up to me, asks me for an ID, and kicks me out for not having one. <br><br>The flights back look bad so we drink a few bottles of wine, get frisky in the airport bathroom, then take a bus to San Francisco, where we catch a flight back to Phoenix.",

We don't actually go into the part, but we walk around the fake downtown for a bit. Afterward have some nice potato dumplings in Burbank. That evening we attend a gong karaoke, where judges bang a big gong if you're bad. The first performer kills it with a rendition of Leo Sayer's \"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\". In a few rounds I go up and try to sing John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy. The intro (33 bars of hand clapping) throws me off and I don't hit a single word. They let me stay on for a little while because I start unbuttoning my shirt, but eventually I get the gong.",
