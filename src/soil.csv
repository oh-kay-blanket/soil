Mexico City	Abidance	346	x	I finish The Bell Jar on the flight. Ryan picks us up and takes us like 2 min straight to a taco alley with all sorts of joints. There's a ska band playing up above our heads. The one we do has stations for each type of taco. We stand in front of a mother pot with all sorts of delicious secrets and share a few cheesy meaty greasy boys with a coke.<br><br>Sweet jamaica tea with chips & chicharron peppers in the kitchen. We get in a line somewhere in the grasshopper hills. Ryan disappears and returns with seafood tostadas y empanadas. A man walks by playing a sleepy jazzy Celito Lindo on a big ass trumpet. We make it through the line and split a mix seafood cocktail. The sauce is sweet and is made with Fanta. Liz fails the saltine challenge. Back in the car for a few min to another taco place. We put our names on the list and wander the tree-consumed block. Chicharron from the store. Into the restaurant for some stupid tacos—beef pastor, mushroom with truffle and beans, squash blossom quesadilla, steak and fries, unreal salsas. Bag drop at home and then out for a walk through beautiful neighborhoods <s>over</s>grown with plants. Yummy coffee from an art gallery that enjoys taking the piss out of Michelin. We stroll by the lush Lincoln Park and nab a nibble of conchinita pibil. To a bar for two rounds and cheese fries. Another bar or maybe two. I've somehow lost count. Am I in an Aztec temple that is also a disco? Yes. They're playing Nortrno and serving insects. My drink tastes like a corn tortilla milkshake. How is it only 9? I'm not hungry, but we go out to dinner—these are the rules. It's a warehouse serving squid ink rice, ceviche and a killer bean & cheese burrito. It only hurts a little, but it feels good a lot.<br><br>We walk through the quiet streets. First stop is coffee. R does espresso and OJ and it fucks (am I using that term correctly, Ryan?). I dunno, maybe it slaps. Next we take the metro to Centro and have some tacos that have been like incubated in oil. This place has actual vats of guac. Through the main square for painted prickly pear and pretty sinking buildings. The cathedral cats tease Liz. Uber back to our part of town for lunch. We're on the second floor of an open terrace overlooking a park. Raw tuna tostada with uni and bonito. Unholy crispy tuna carnitas. Fish two ways. Meringue with whipped cream and fruit. No luck with bike rental so we talk and walk. We teach Liz about poppers. Siesta #1 in the park lying on some grass. Siesta #2 at home. Back out for dinner at a standing taco restaurant. The gordita is muy good. The next two places we try (a bakery and a Thai taco spot) are sold out. We settle with nutty gelato. Almost home, but Ryan sneaks in a cheeky street Pastor for us to share. These are the rules, we abide. Bed.<br><br>Liz and I get a ride to Teotihuacán. We walk the wide promenade and take in the respective pyramids of the Sun and Moon. Nobody knows who built them or why. They are filled in, unlike the African kind. These likely acted as the most mega badass sacrificial alters humans have ever created. East to a cave restaurant for some yummy mutton consommé, corn soup, chicharron monoliths in guac, and mole. Walking back to the site, we hear fireworks going off. A bit further on and we are lured by the sounds of a marching band...who aren't marching. It's a sort of parade that stopped to cool off under some trees. In a few minutes someone passes around plastic cups. Then someone else comes by and puts brandy in them and someone else Coke. We abide. More exploring. A kindly man sells us bracelets of questionable metal. Back to town. Museo Soumaya for lots of sculptures and many other good things mashed up in close quarters. The 17th century monkey and cat barbershop is a standout. To the store for salsa matcha and back home. A very quick clean up and then to Ticuchi. Three killer cocteles. Rice puffs with salsa. Shredded cheese with cacao. Tamal with huitlacoche. Tostada with shrimp chorizo. White mole with carrots. Big crispy guy with mole, plantain, cheese and seepweed. Another rice crisp. Little corn. Pavlova with rosemary oil. Tres leches with cardamom. Popcorn helado. That's not quite enough food so Ryan takes us by a churro shop for those and hot chocolate. I know better than to fight it. Chats, hugs and bed.<br><br>Up at 4 to fly home.	19.433601, -99.185281	Jan 16, 2026	Jan 20, 2026	Ryan																https://photos.app.goo.gl/TF3KwssE1p3zqSTV8
New York City	NYChristmas	345	x	On the plane I watch Terminator 2 and the first half of 28 Years Later. Easy peasy to our hotel in Long Island City. Across the street to Dutch Kills for Christmas vibes, a jukebox overpowered by the DJs, and yummy drinks. Late to bed.<br><br>Late awake. Ride down to Win Son Bakery for an egg and cheese on scallion pancake with a black sesame latte. We decide to walk to Williamsburg, with a few stops along the way. To Edith's for a tahini cold brew slushie. Then to Quimby's for weird books and sleeping cats. Next is Union Pool for a pilsner and chemical photo booth #1. A stall on the street for photo booth #2 @ Old Friend. Big ol' pants from COS. Pizza from Vinnie's. To an art market for an Al Pacino paper mache. Car ride east to TWA Hotel. A little lie down and then we get pretty. Liz puts on this stunning red velvet dress. I hurry up and finish The Magic Necklace so she can wear the pears around the incredible space. I take one million pictures of her looking so beautiful and in her space.<br><br>We nibble on pastries, check out and scope the runway from the rooftop. I head out to meet D&B at the Oyster bar at Grand Central. I nibble and sip while we catch up for a bit. To the 5th Ave COS for a cute skirt. On the way to the hotel I spot 30 Rock. Hang and clean up with Liz in the hotel for a bit before Carmine's for dinner with the family. I get to chat with Tucker a lot which is so wonderful. The dinner is salads with red wine and then a mix of pastas and veal marsala. Dessert is tiramisu cheesecake and cannoli. It's also lovely and it's just great to be together with everyone. We stand outside and chat for a bit and eventually part ways. Liz and I walk along with Justin and family over to Rockefeller center and take in the tree before also each heading back to our respective hotels.<br><br>I sleep in until 11:30. I decide to do a bit of shopping at Mango where I find some nice things and then stroll through Central Park. It's pretty and definitely feels like early winter. There's a drizzle and the trees are losing their leaves. Back to the hotel where Liz and I snack on chicken wings and a wagyu burger with drinks to complement. Cozy then clean up and to Dear Irving, on Broadway where we meet Krys and Devyn for a little pre game. Dinner is stupid and incredible. We get a kitchen tour in the end.<br><br>No brekkie. To Bryant Park. Plunkett under the tree and then twins at the grill. We pop by a bakery then stroll up 5th. I buy things for the boys from the Adidas store. Clean up at the hotel and then to Oceana. We have a private room in the middle of the restaurant. K&D set up a personalized set menu with 45 minutes of hors d'oeuvres like coconut shrimp, mushroom arancini, steak with chimicuri, an little potatoes with caviar. The meal consists of mushroom risotto, crab cake, halibut, filet mignon, chocolate budino, and lemon curd cake, all with plenty of wine. Dinner is a joy. After the meal is complete, we stay around for probably another 70 minutes chatting and taking pictures and polishing off some bottles. We are feeling ambitious and want to check out the Rockefeller center tree, but 5 minutes into attempting to parse through the crowds we opt for a much smaller pretty Christmas tree right next to us. Nikki and I belt Cindi Lauper. After many hugs and kisses, Liz and I nab our bags and make for Jersey City. More hugs and some Coven.<br><br>A lazy morning filled with Coven, pain au chocolate & bg3 for me. We walk to the AMC near his place for The Housemaid, which is good fun. A quick relax and then to Shanghai 21 in Chinatown. They say it's a 90 min wait, but we find a decent little bar called Basement to warm our hands and tummies. Dinner is tea, soup dumplings, little buns, scallion pancakes, crispy beef, eggplant with garlic, mapo dofu. Back for Pluribus with spritzes and then Coven with French hot chocolate.<br><br>Very lazy day. Breakfast bagel sandwichs & bg3. Eventually Coven and homemade butter chicken and garlic naan. Snow falls throughout the evening.<br><br>The ground is mostly white. Slow start with leftovers and then up to meet Sean & Cori at MOMA for the Ruth Asawa exhibit. We see patterns. Iterations. Breaks. Returns. The floor below features some excellent paint on things from folks of renown. A short walk and a long wait outside and we're in Tomi Jazz. It's dark and maximalist. A model train makes quiet loops around the ceiling. A jazz trio grooves. To a tiny back room. Where the music fills the ambiance. We get a bottle of sake and a bunch of treats. Udon with cod roe, yakisoba, katsu sando, mapo dofu, curry udon, okonomiyaki, spam rolls, fried brie, cucumber with miso. After a bit they move us into the main room, just next to the band, which is special. Kisses.<br><br>To a spot for bagels. A robot is picking up an order. Back to his for a bec and a lox. Killer. Davey drives us to Philly. To the Philadelphia Art Museum for the Surrealism at 100 exhibit. After taking in a bunyit great surrealist art we split and wander through different parts of the massive building. I take in some Asian spaces. Next to Woodrow's for cheesteak sandos. David drops us at the airport where we lounge in the Chase lounge before catching the flight home.	40.645398, -73.777790	Dec 20, 2025	Dec 28, 2025	Plunkett Family, David																https://photos.app.goo.gl/dV826on6V9g1P3fAA
Orlando	Getting Gay	344	x	Too busy to take note, apparently. Pride. Pizza. Two tiki bars. 	28.545556, -81.373128	Oct 17, 2025	Oct 19, 2025	Michael & David, Glo & Garrett																https://photos.app.goo.gl/2v3BVv4t6NkboJVt7
Houston	Spacing Out	343	x	We drive from Dallas and get downtown at 10. Liz takes us to Tiny Champions for massaged cabbage, vegan butter beans, anchovy pizza, and fennel caramel cookies. To bed.<br><br>I make gross coffee in the room and research hair transplants in Turkey. Siphon for sunken flavor lattes and hangover fries. The Rothko Chapel. Down to NASA for space stuff. We opt for the Apollo command center tour, which is pretty unreal. ChòpinBlok for steak skewers, grilled shrimp, fried plantain, stew and plantain bread. Nickel City has a resident feline. Early to bed for me.<br><br>Slow drip for coffee guys and breakfast tacos. Into the old warehouse district for Meow Wolf. It's set in a radio station. The spaces are intimate and creative. There are many opportunities for musical interactions. And there's a killer Texas dive bar called Cowboix Hevvven. We get Lone Stars and suck at pool. This is the best Meow Wolf. Into Soma for some cute undies and then to Alora for Viet Peruvian. Everything is beautiful. Next to White Oak Music Hall for Djo. The bad is tight. The music is great. We drive north and get home before 2 a.m.	29.550877, -95.097185	Oct 3, 2025	Oct 5, 2025																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/vvMm5yoeFRucgiXo6
Minneapolis	SpamCon	342	x	In bed at 1.<br><br>We work from the room, trying not to talk over each other on calls. Expensive coffee from across the street. Liz orders stupid good Italian sandwiches from somewhere. Dinner is Owamni. Corn soup. Caramelized corn. Charred veggies. Salmon tartare. Refried beans. Tea. Epazote Martini.<br><br>I don't keep track of everything, but we spend three days puzzling the heck out of our brains. We nab yummy hot dogs. Word on the Street with Sandy & friends. The highlight is the Extravaganza, which is a bunch of neat puzzles about the fictional city of Reme. It culminates in a scavenger hunt with some very creative lego displays.	44.981136, -93.260407	Jul 16, 2025	Jul 20, 2025	Marc																https://photos.app.goo.gl/X9DkEqsV5fHVQepz5
Lyon	Circles	341	x	Check into the hotel and nap for a bit. At 6:00 we get a ride to Les Lyonnais in Vieux Lyon for a buchon. Pork & potato pie plus a pike souffle in lobster sauce. Wine of course. I order two glasses of wine in French and our server says "Woah, your French is very good". I say "Vous etes tres gentile" and he says "No. I lied, it's not good." Back home. We're both wiped and call it early.<br><br>Liz has a kidney stone. They let us check out at three. I apply for a job. To Les Halls de Lyon Paul Bocuse. Most stalls are shut down, but we get a praline tart and macrons from one. At another we do a seafood tower and great wine. To Comptoirs de Cottoniers for some more cute baggy pants. We get a ride to pick up bags and go to our new hotel at the airport. Liz is still unwell. I work on code and grab beer, calamari & burrata pizza from the restaurant downstairs.<br><br>A nice little breakfast and then to onto the plane. Change in London and back home.	45.784998, 4.853006	Jun 21, 2025	Jun 24, 2025																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/ja6Hdp7rgxmfUc3J9

Dominique picks us is along with two other attendees. Hellos to the folks we know. A clean up and a change in our room and then downstairs for mingling. We make a few new aquatinces. Pizza and wine in the green space until it gets too dark to see. Bed and dead.<br><br>We wake at noon, clean up and head down. The wedding is gorgeous. The speeches are heartfelt. The couple is precious. To another area for a puzzle game. Photos, hors d'ouvres and wine in the yard for a few hours. In time we're in the hall for an excellent vegetarian dinner of rice and zucchini balls in a delicious Indian sauce. Shoe quiz. Wine. Cheese. Dancing. All night. We go to bed when the sun comes up.<br><br>Pain au chocolate avec les amis. At 12 Alexis takes us to the station. We ride to Lyon with Anaïs, Alexia's sister. We talk family and therapy.	47.136090, 4.949475	Jun 18, 2025	Jun 21, 2025	Alexia & Sego, Melvin, Pibi, Jan, Jannick, Sam & Madrid																https://photos.app.goo.gl/ja6Hdp7rgxmfUc3J9
Paris	Circles	339	x	I watch John Wick on the flight and get some good sleep. 11:02: We land at CDG and get a ride to the Marriott. A few hours of napping and we head out at 4:30. We head to Maison Philippe Conticini (the chef who did Patesserie des Reves) for a black-coated tender vanilla guy, a raspberry tart and a canelé. There are no seats in the shop so we head to a nearby park and munch and take fisheye selfies. 6:48: We stop at a random cute bistro for a beer and Aperol spritz. VIII: Liz takes us to an inconspicuous sundial made by Sal Dali. 8:32: Arrive at Bar Nouveau for a Ramos Whisky Fizz and a Delicious Sour. 10:11: L'As de Falafel for a falafel sandwich and a shawarma sandwich plus frites with lots of mayo for me. We hold hands walking through the cool dark streets. 11:02: The Cambridge Public House. We give one another cocktail-like descriptors. Liz: Complex - Cheeky - Adventurous. Kayla: Curious - Funky - Deep. 12:43: Back at the hotel. Straight to bed.<br><br>8:28: I'm dead, but up in a rush to bounce out a bit past 8:45. I wear my cute new polka dot dress. Our first stop is Musee des Arts Forains. Our guide is the same gentleman as before. This place is magical. 11:32: Cafe au lait from Pauline. 12:07: Musee Melies. They have a special exhibition of Wes Anderson film goods, so naturally we do both. Two magicians. 3:24: Bourse de Commerce and an onigiri in line. 6:09: COS for a cute dress. 6:50: Danico for four Peruvian-inspired cocktails and two superlative pizzas with soft, crispy, chewy dough. Still pretty early: Dead in bed. We sleep for something like 11 hours.<br><br>9:46: The hotel breakfast is pretty yummy. I work on savoring my bites. 10:15: Out and on some rails to Dijon	48.854060, 2.323162	Jun 16, 2025	Jun 18, 2025																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/ja6Hdp7rgxmfUc3J9
Cody	No Country for (39 year) Old Men	338	x	We land in Billings late and, tempted as we are for late night tacos, the bed calls.<br><br>Slow rise. Cold foam. Dive bar burgers and shake. Humans hugs and kisses. Whitney. Landscapes. Huckleberry taffy. Cody. Blanca Tatanka. Ice cream. Groceries. Elliot. Scott and Missy.<br><br>In the middle of the night. Kayla: "Is someone there?". Liz: "Yes." Kayla: "Who is it?" Liz: "Liz." Kayla: "Sorry, I'm really confused". I fall back asleep. Sage brush. No trespassing. Lychee coffee. Breakfast tacos. A drive. Horses. Smoke. Playboy. Spade. Junior. Razor. Shadow. Star. Rock formations. More groceries, Elliot and alcohol. Spritzes. Pasta. Pasta. Bread sticks. Salad. Salad. Cookies. High wind. "Is anyone else having a pleasant time?" Monikers. Kate Bush. Child soldiers. Nutcracker. Rasputin. <br><br>Oatmeal griddle cakes with cinnamon maple butter plus bacon and great coffee. Clean up and down the road a few for our Bridal Veil Falls. We have an uneventful way for a bit. Then a lot happens at once. We realize we missed the turn off. Liz gets quite red. And a storm looms deep in the valley. We cool off for a few a nibble sandwiches. Sean and India jog off towards the cars. The rest of us walk. Fortunately the storm goes the other direction. Back and back. Liz is unwell. I spend a while in the bathroom with her. First it's pretty scary, but she slowly seems in slightly less pain. We nap together a good bit. Nikhil arrives. We hang, do yummy chicken tacos, and then do surprise times for Sean. India and Cori made cowboy shirts with Sean's face on them, plus Thunderhoof tattoos. Liz joins. A nice happy birthday song and then delicious cake outside. Back in for spritzes, pictures and a bunch more Monikers.<br><br>Up & at 'em.	44.910949, -109.217234	May 8, 2025	May 12, 2025	Sean & Cori, India, Nikhil, Scott & Missy																https://photos.app.goo.gl/LfDoGqs5LoiwShG37
Las Vegas	The Terminal	337	x	Redemption burgers from Smash and then we're in Vegas. Our last leg of our last trip at American. I couldn't think of a more appropriate place for this. To the Westin for a nap. Downstairs for a drink surrounded by a bunch of Dead Heads. Up and out to Omega Mart for a nice, trippy time. The light shows feel particularly good at this location. Our next stop is Shang for Dan Dan and beef shank noodles. Zoom back for a pretty up and then zoom again to Venetian for Dita. Holy cow this theater is incredible. Giant metal bursts of shapes a la Metropolis. There are only round tables, no rows of chairs. The floor is just a gentle slope up. Bubbles are suspended above. The stage features a catwalk that goes well into the theatre. I absolutely love the vibe. The show is wonderful. Similar to the horseshoe show, but a bit more intimate & paired down. Up to the arts district for Velveteen Rabbit, a low key yet refined cocktail bar, for a few yummy drinks. We pick up a cheeky schwarma on the way back and eat that boy in bed. Dead.<br><br>Dead. Up at maybe 10. Voices hoarse. From smoke I guess. I have a productive shower/meds/stretch/breakfast. Free desserts to go. Into Red Dwarf for cinnamon cider, a Dole Whip in a devil's head, Detroit pizza, and Generic Surf Rock Band. This bar kicks ass. Over to PINBALL where we I work on my strategy and we spend a short while reconnecting with the Harris-Hepworth family. To the airport for home times. This is our final trip at AA. What a run it has been.	36.136606, -115.135552	Mar 29, 2025	Mar 31, 2025	Harris-Hepworth																https://photos.app.goo.gl/kfpNDfcTcAkk5z6D8
Rapa Nui	The Terminal	336	x	Up very early to the airport. All goes smoothly. We get a pizza to celebrate. We fly west on a Dreamliner for five hours and land on a tiny dot of land in the midst of the vastness of the Pacific. A band is playing for disembarking passengers. We catch a taxi ride with a nice Russian woman. Diego helps us get settled in. He brings us waters and beers. We sit out and sip. Chickens pass. A kitty peeks his head from above. After a good nap we get cleaned up and walk into town. We book a couple of tours for tomorrow. At the pier we get ice cream. Along the oceanfront for a bit and through some side streets. To Le-Frits for a tuna & cheese empanada plus fish and chips. We chat with a lady who reminds us of Barb. She gives some helpful advice. Heading back a dog befriends Liz. She is enthusiastic and flops onto her back to ask for pets.<br><br>Up at 5:30. The van picks us up and takes us to Ahu Tongariki, a line of fifteen moai at the edge of the ocean. It's completely dark when we arrive. The Milky Way is on full display as we sip instant coffee. Down a dark path. I can hear the ocean and see very little. Dew on the ground. As the light creeps in shapes emerge. Silhouettes take form. Noses. Foreheads. A hat. Each head is unique, as though modeled after a spefic person. Yet they are all unreal. No living human looks like this. I'm told each statue took a dozen people working for a year to create. How they moved them I can't imagine. Dogs play chase. Bugs float to life. In the middle of the field a fallen moai states at the sky. When it's time to leave we discover the van has a dead battery. They try to perform a rolling start, but to no avail. In 10 minutes the place is abandoned. We have the moai to ourselves. A grouse visits. I can see a band of wild horses roaming the hill nearby. After time passes, another bus shows up. It looks like maybe the old bus. It's charming and reminds me of the school buses of my childhood. Back to the office and then immediately on another bus for tour number two. For the course of 5 hours, we hit five different spots. First is a place where they celebrate the new year. Up against the ocean. The 4th and the 5th are where the birdman competition took place around a marshy crater and a small island. Over the centuries, they stopped making statues and became more warrior like. This competition was the way to determine the next ruler. Back in town. We have them drop us by Le Frits for a lunch of ceviche. One of them is served in an open empanada and is in a coconut cream. It's fantastic. Our floppy girl from last night is out front. Inside a sweet ginger tom lets us give him some tuna. A chicken in the restaurant also gets a few scraps of bread and fries. Home and mostly we sleep A LOT. In the late evening we do get up for a bit do drink bubbles and solve cryptics.<br><br>We miss breakfast so we finish our tuna empanada and walk down the street for coffee. I pick up a little jeep and get Liz. Soon we're off and cruising down the coast. Windows down. Wind blowing. Fluffy clouds. Flowing grass. Winding road. To Rano Raraku, the volcano mountain quarry where all of the moai were carved. Many were taken to other parts of the island, but there are loads here, populating the mountainside. The man at the ticket counter says it's impossible to come in without a guide. Fortune must be smiling upon us, however, because there happens to be a small group that is getting ready to go in beside us and they state they are willing to let us join them. Our guide winds us along and up the mountain, pointing out the varying states of completion and features of these guys. Some are buried so deep that I don't even notice them until she calls it out. This doesn't feel real. They are all over. Standing up, leaning over, face down and broken. It feels to perfect to be real. Like Walt Disney funded this fantastical land. From over one of the hills I spot the fifteen guys from yesterday. It's quiet. We pass a couple other small groups, but mostly it feels we have the place to ourselves. What an experience. We have yummy tuna steak sandwiches at the base. From there we make for Anakena Beach for some sun, silly play time in the waves, goofy selfies and more moai, this time with hair! We take the road back to Hanga Roa that cuts through the middle of the island. Shortly into the drive we slow because a band of horses is playing in the road. After a minute about ten more run right past the car to join in and they all kick off together into the wilderness. Near town we stop at another grouping of moia on the coast that is meant to be particularly good for sunset views. It's far too cloudy (and now a bit drizzly) for a sunset, but we appreciate the view anyway. One of these guys even has his eyeballs filled in. As we were pulling into the park we passed a restaurant that looked very cute and smelled of garlic. We pop in for a dinner of sangria, cocktail, ceviche and risotto with tuna. Back home. Liz later informs me that I was asleep within seconds of lying down. She wakes me up a couple of hours later to help her through the brut and I struggle to keep awake through that.<br><br>The power goes out in the middle of my shower. When I get up to the hotel restaurant for breakfast, the room is lit with candles. I nab the last of the coffee and also milk for cereal. I overhear from a table over that the power is off for the whole island. They are having a very timeless old married couple disagreement as to whether the airport has a back up generator. We check out and I drop Liz straight to the airport. I am now feeling very comfortable driving the jeep. I feel I finally get the hang of shifting into 2nd smoothly. I drop it back off with Irene, who then drives me back to the airport. We have a good chat about music. Everything is easy peasy. I watch Prometheus. Back in Santiago, we order McDonald's during our layover. However, the timing doesn't work out and I have to bolt for the gate just before they can put out the order. Liz had been waiting at the gate and they were being total dicks to her, threatening to close the door, even though we still had a while before the standard cut off. They let me on, burgerless. Back home for a couple hours of cat pets and naps and then back to the airport.	-27.122288, -109.288633	Mar 25, 2025	Mar 28, 2025																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/kfpNDfcTcAkk5z6D8
Santaigo	The Terminal	335	x	From the curb we're in seats in less than ten minutes. Liz gets business and I PE. Into the air. It smells a bit like burning. The sky is hazy and the mountains to the east fade into a piercing creamy white where the sun is backlighting a swath of sky. Our driver says something we don't understand. He drives a stick and hugs the curves of the highway. It's a Kia model I've not seen. Willows and muhly line the road. The city is waking up. Hawkers set up on blankets. Power washers blast concrete. A shopkeeper sweeps her entry. An old woman has one of those carts that all old women pull. Huge maple trees line what feels like an old important road. A steel bust in the park is adorned with graffiti. I'm reminded of Ithilien. Our hotel looks designed for diplomats. The lobby is populated with band-looking folk. A sign says Welcome to Lollapalooza. Our room isn't ready, so we Internet and Enigma for a bit before catching a ride to Persa Biobio. Vendors sprawl for blocks beforehand. The density increases. We're dropped in the middle. We wander and bonk our way to Kilig, where I have a killer espressotonic. Sidewalk tiles clink and thud under the foot traffic. People don't seem to be bothered by the fact that we speak little Spanish and they little English. I get a pair of earrings so probably Sara. We pass a stand with an interesting-looking drink and get it. It is peach juice, dried peaches, and wheat berries. Next to Willimapu for chupilca, ceviche, mussels soup, and salmon with papas. The service is forgetful, but when the right food makes it to the table, it is incredible. We end with a mix of wine, sugar and toasted flour. We wander a bit more and then head back to the hotel. A few hours of napping, phoning and watching dance videos and then we walk to CHPE Libre. Civiche, bean hummus with carob sauce. Pisco sours. We had intended to do pizza next, but we're old babes and go back. I shower and am then completely zapped.<br><br>I wake up ten hours later. Breakfast downstairs and some spoons. At one something we take the metro to a bus to Valparaiso. Lots of walking to the center of town. A lot of the buildings seem run down and closed, but it may just be Sunday. Up a funicular to our favorite hill. I find some cute lady prints for the girls. I get an instant crush on the tgirl working at the liquor store at the bottom of the hippy staircase. We grab a couple and drink outside where everything is gorgeous. A sweet doggo with a featherd-end tail lets me scratch her bum. Up the stairs. More wandering and then to Fat Kid Burger for yummy smash guys and guac fries. Slow wander down the hill. Lights twinkle on as the sky goes pastel. A few kitties make themselves known. We're feeling wrapped up and try for an earlier bus, but the drivers are rigid. More puzzles while we wait and then a nice ride home. We get a free ride on the city bus to the hotel and crash. Squiggles makes sure I wash my face.<br><br>Early breakfast and checkout. Alvarado picks us up for our wine tour of Casablanca Valley. Our group is a bunch of fun kids. Angel, Alex, Silvan, Daria and Marie. We hit it off quickly. First stop is fine organic stuff, but unmemorable. There is a baby llama we don't get that close to. #2 has sparkles and chickens. #3 is a sassy guy with nicer wines and liquors. #4 is food and now we're just silly. Daria orders for everyone and it's great. Sangria. We decide to all meet for dinner in Barrio Italia. Back to the hotel for some lounge time. I clean up in the bathroom and then we head to dinner. Ramses, Daria, Marie, Alex, Silvan, Liz and I spend a good few hours there eating, drinking and being merry. We get a big plank of fries covered in cheese sauce and cooked meats. There are multiple rounds of Jager shots. I get something in a big Barbie head. Silvan serenades the group. Marie looks paralyzed by him. In time they go dancing and we head out. We stay in a place just by the airport.	-33.321759, -71.408360	Mar 21, 2025	Mar 25, 2025																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/kfpNDfcTcAkk5z6D8

San Louis Obispo	Still SLO	333	x	We land, get a Kia, and drive straight to High Street Deli. After appetizer of cherry/coke and potato chips, we get two of the best sandwiches. Perfection. They aren't wild, just perfect-like food in Italy. Down the street is a cemetery featuring a Masonic pyramid on a small hill. We admire the stonework and head to the Madonna in. Our room isn't quite ready, so we explore the grounds. The main dining room brings me great joy and warmth. It is solely comprised of round red booths. The color scheme is red and gold. That is almost exclusively what is see. There are cherubs in the low chandeliers. It is gorgeous. I want to live here. They put us in Bit of Solvang, a two-double room with lots of blue & white and touches of gold. We nap. I epilate. Then to the pool. We make some friends in the Jacuzzi. Catherine and I have a nice chat in the room as we get pretty and head to Goshi. They say there will be a bit of a wait, so we head to a wine bar for a bit of bubbly. We're only halfway through our first glass when we get the text. We down it and sit at the bar. Draft Suntori. Butterfish, blue mackerel, tamago, salmon, torched salmon belly, toro hand roll with pickle. We order an uni toro caviar hand roll. They are out of caviar, so instead the give us FOUR uni toro hand rolls. Two with Santa Barbara uni and two with Japanese uni. They may possibly be the most delicious things I've ever eaten. In that moment we are both fully absorbed in the stunning beauty of the food. Hamapeño roll and a spicy tuna roll with garlic chips. Goshi is perfection. Back to the room for a short lie down and then to the Silver Bar. A Big Band plays for the restaurant. Couples and families dance. Liz gets a pink cloud and I a paper plane. Eva and Matt, from the hot tub, greet us and join for a drink. It's cute and fun and kinda(?) flirty. She calls us gorgeena, which I adore. Back in the room I fall asleep while trying to kill the rest of the prosecco and eat fancy Kit Kats.<br><br>I clean up and head to Kreuzberg for coffee and pastries. We dine in bed while looking out over the horse field. To High Street Deli again. We're cutting it very close on time, but sweet Nat hands us the precious cargo just as we have to bolt to the airport. Straight onto the plane.	35.267338, -120.674675	Feb 22, 2025	Feb 23, 2025																	
Tucson 	Solid. Gas. Liquid.	332	x	We make our final house payment on the flight. The colors are all pastel leaving the airport. Gentle hugs. Harsh plants. Exo for cortado and a hard cookie. We sit in the cool morning sun. Down south to Cafe Santa Rosa for popovers and cinnamon tea. East on the 10 to the Pima Air and Space Museum. Up to Cabali. Smoky carrot and orange guy. Ahi tacos and luau pork. 	32.191953, -110.968085	Feb 1, 2025	Feb 1, 2025																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/QSgTAkSord4ZfHEF9
Galveston	Dicken Around	331	x	Taco Casa on the way down. Specs for bourbon and egg nog for our hosts. To the house with Jamie, Jerry and Emily. We sip some spirits into the night and eat cold thin-crust pizza.<br><br>Both Aidy and I wake up in the middle of the night with sore throats. I think we're sick. We wake up again at noon and feel fine. It's raining and gray. Cozy coffee and biscuits with jam. We all get gussied up in our finest Victorian attire. Aidy and I are whores, Chelsea is our Madame while Jerry & Emily are pickpockets. We are all perfectly lacking in any dignity. The looks we get from some of the finer dressed members of society communities this hilariously. A group of priests calls us sinners. It is all in jest (I think anyway). We play it up. It's pretty chilly, but we settle down by a heater for a bit and sip our Sailing Santas with fried shrimp and scotch eggs. The parade is very cute. Lots of bagpipers. Car antics. I buy a toy cat for Liz. Into the member's club. More beer. A beautiful choir group performance. Back outside for glögg and nighttime wanderings. Steak and ale pies. Whole spicy peanuts. In the petting zoo. Lots of goats. Bunnies. Two kangaroos. Back home for more eggnog, Beyonce whisky and French onion dip. Nice cuddles.<br><br>Up at a much more reasonable time. Coffee and cleaning. The Ladies of Ill Repute head to Shrimp 'n' Stuff for fried shrimp, boiled shrimp, coconut shrimp, hush puppies, spicy boiled red potatoes, tea and tartar sauce. Buc-ee's and back. 	29.306250, -94.794085	Dec 6, 2024	Dec 8, 2024	Aidy & Chelsea, Jerry, Jamie, Emily																https://photos.app.goo.gl/y5TXQCGE9Mr2FRhs9
Tokyo	Five Years	330	x	On the flight I watch Alien Covenant, Deadpool vs Wolverine, Bad Education and Do the Right Thing plus some cryptic coding. Tokyo is intense. The train stations are all crowded and bustling. There's a huge gashapon bank and we get a cheese one for Chelsea. We're arriving during the Friday evening rush hour. To Ebisu and our little hotel room. Liz is wiped, but I'm craving a ramen and head to Fuunji. The line isn't too long. It's as good as I remember. I'm so full of good stuff.<br><br>We get up at 8. I do a brief outing to find coffee and end up at Family Mart. I sneak in a maple man and spicy fried chicken. The chicken has me melting. After a clean up we walk up Cat Street to Micasadeco for the fluffiest pancakes with ricotta plus an orange Americano and a sweet potato latte. We wander down Omote Sando and go to Hakusan where we buy a lot of kanpeki ceramics. Onward to Juan Bowl & Tea for wagyu rice bowls with fixin's. The nasu side with sumiso is killer. Dessert is matcha tiramisu and a goma jello. Oishii desu. Through the madness of Takeshitadori for the love of Sanrio and gashapon. To Meiji Jingu where we don't find incense for Amy Booth. I forgot how nice the warm toilet seats are. I got a scared and confused look from a man entering the restroom as I was leaving. I'm using the men's here and am dressed down to what feels quite masc for me, so it was especially nice and affirming. Down to the madness of Shibuya where we load up on nonperishables at Donki and don't find little people at Hands. To the hotel where we zonk out until midnight. Back up and at 'em to SG Club. Four delicious drinks deep. We're a bit tipsy at Sushi Zanmai. It's 4 a.m. and we just ordered a bunch of fatty tuna. We talk about love and sex and our feelings. We get an Uber to Church where we have g&ts and dance to some good groves by a super cute DJ. We're hit on by two guys nearly immediately and have some fun dancing with them for a bit. [The following content has been edited to be suitable for all viewers]: Then we said goodbye.<br><br>Not too hungover. I process some feelings with Liz and I am doing much better. In time we get cute and JR it up to Koenji. We get in line for Tensuke. It takes a good while so we occupy ourselves with Boggle and Enigma flats. It zips by and we're in. Hot tea. Bowl of rice with tempura egg, tempura bites and a heavenly sauce. Ebi, squid, fish, nasu, broccoli, green pepper, shrimp ball. He is sweet and gentle and does his funny little dance. Liz calls this one of the best meals in her life. She says it is perfection of simplicity. Shops, shops, vintage shops. A cute yellow cardigan. Buskers. Many. Trans people too. A few. Antique stationary. Return to Shinjuku for Hands, Tokyu Hands. No miniature figurines, but we get puzzles. A walk over to Gyoza no Fukuho. We eat 24 gyoza plus some divine cucumber with spicy miso sauce. We had intended to do Golden Gai and then yakiniku, but it's 9 p.m. and we're both just dead already. Bed.<br><br>Wake up twelve hours later. Lazy for a bit. I am in bliss eating my first egg salad sando. This one from Lawson's. Perfection. To Kisaburo Nojo in Sengoku for a BUNCH of raw eggs. They all come from one specialty farm. Many of the types come from chickens that are fed special foods like rice or yuzu. Liz eats seven. To Ginza and the Moomin store where I get some goodies for Kyle. Then to Ginza Six where we take in all the catastronauts. We relax on the rooftop and take in this perfect day. North on the Ginza line to Inaricho. Liz wants to check out a temple nearby. She didn't tell me that it is a KAPPA TEMPLE. After checking out those guys and gals we walk east to Kappabashi where we hunt for flat green plates and nice gifts for friends. A good bit of that and then down to Dandelion for drink and cake. It's nice to relax and do puzzles for a bit. We have a beautiful thirty-minute walk to Kikanbo for some spicy and sanchoy ramen. Ginza line straight to bed.<br><br>Coffee. Family Mart egg salad sando. We have now completed the holy trinity. Liz shows off her wizardry in packing an incredible amount of stuff into just a few bags. We open up some sake I bought yesterday just for the cool cup with two of pufferfish in it only to find a pufferfish fin floating inside. I attempt a few fishy sips, but soon decide the cup is all I care for here. We check out and walk to Blue Bottle for yummy guys. We start walking to yakiniku, but change our minds when we see Shake Shack has a maitake burger. After all, Dallas has yakiniku. It's great. Soon enough we make the trek to Haneda. Liz takes a gamble on an old mare and we nab the last two seats on the nonstop home!	35.705826, 139.648772	Nov 28, 2024	Dec 3, 2024																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZB1tZFkxxdktEKdW7
Nashville	Twu Wuv	329	x	I meet Heather at the Farmer's Market. Today is the Turnip Green Festival. I get some yummy fried catfish & greens and after a bit she and I serve up a bunch of greens for a big line of folks. Home. Fart car. Choy for scallion pancake, bok choy, cumin lamb ribs, killer green beans, and Chrysanthemum ice cream. Romeo + Juliet. Frodo's got one in the chamber.<br><br>Chive weeds. Up the hill to Scuits. Yolanda joins for great sandos and cookies. Pedis. Heather gives me a haircut. Outside wine times & a bonfire. I burn my locks. Robbie tells me about Kublai Khan TX, Mom Jeans & Polyphia. Heather makes us scallops on beurre orange, charred broccolini, parsnip puree, and a juicy ribeye. Sleepy babes.<br><br>Honey Bear cold brew. Robbie puts on respectable pants. Bee and wasp visit us out front. Kisser. Kabocha salad, egg salad sando, yellowtail collar, katsu curry, creamy bacon udon, miso creme brûlée, yuzu merengue. Mimosas. I document Heather making and apple pie and being cute outside. Photo booth with tits out. Pizza takeout. Escape From New York. Apple pie. Hugs.	36.170694, -86.788871	Nov 2, 2024	Nov 5, 2024	Heather & Robbie																https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZB1tZFkxxdktEKdW7
Anchorage	Big Beauty	328	x	Early to the airport. We split and I get in the first flight. I chat with Aidy and code for a bit. Liz arrives around 2. Tommy's burgers for lunch are good, though unmemorable. Next to Kincaid Park for a very nice walk and pretty views. We meet a squirrel plus some doggos and appreciate ducks from afar. Back for a rest and then to 49th State Brewing for a smoked lager, pine needle soda, halibut and chips and a big gorgeous soft pretzle with beer cheese. We drive a bit into the mountains for lights. We see some okay stuff, but the light pollution is still strong here. We go another 30 min north and really get into the good stuff. This is the best night we've seen so far. Pretty pretty pretty.<br><br>We chat with Aidy, who gives Cino some good butt pats. Lunch at Moose's Tooth for stunning pizza. One is brat w/mustard base. The other is blackened chicken with apricot base. Meh coffee. I get a cute fox for Lola. South and East along the winding, foggy, pretty coast. After an hour we're at Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, a plot of land for rescue wild animals. Elk, reindeer, bison, porcupines, foxes, wolves, coyotes, lynxes, a bear, an eagle, an owl, moose and deer. It's a joy. We see the coyotes getting tossed rats. The eagle is stunning and only has one wing because someone tried to kill it thirty years ago. We get wet. Liz's feet don't though. Back. Rest. Bear Tooth for margarita, beer, salmon salad and cod & chips. Clouds and rain mean it's a Ripley night.<br><br>A bit of hotel breakfast and a relatively early start. We head east on the same road as yesterday to Whittier. Through the two-mile-long car/train tunnel into the "quaint" (so I read online) town. Driving around, it's more of a fishing port with a couple of restaurants whose online hours didn't reflect that they've all already shuttered for the season. We can't get to the cool abandoned hotel so back through the tunnel. The intense cold and rain today tell us the Kenai Fjords National Park might not be the best this to continue towards. We opt instead for a few great slices of pizza and head back to Anchorage. We settle in to watch the last four episodes of Ripley with support of Field Recordings wines and Whiskey & Ramen deliciousness.	61.155174, -150.069930	Oct 10, 2024	Oct 13, 2024																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/H1qcKMAsySSTVguY7
North Texas	My Fair Ladies	327	x	Taco Casa, the vintage Taco Bell. Hotel. Ripped carpets. Crowbar marks. Pretty ladies. Fancy hotel drinks. Jamie, James & Emily. Rooftop times. FUGA fantastique. Jerry's place for kitties, drama, cuddles and catch ups. Nice times at the hotel.<br><br>Busty's for Bloody Marys, beers, onion petals, burritos, smash burgers, taquitos, skip sauce, jello shots, frozen cherry coke and very fine humans. Hotel clothing swap. Canje for cocktails, plantain chips, ceviche with peanuts, beef curry and sorbet with rum. Tiki Tatsu-ya for cocktails and alien invasions.<br><br>Up and at 'em to the State Fiar. Corny dogs, pickle beer, Dominican dog, shoe 'n' glue, Excel pin, Ferris Wheel, kebabs and funnel cake.	32.776706, -96.759319	Oct 18, 2024	Oct 20, 2024	Aidy, Chelsea, Jerry	Austin, Dallas															https://photos.app.goo.gl/K95WACCHiGbp44tH6
Fairbanks	Big Beauty	326	x	We get Whataburger. Krystle and I have a nice chat on the flight. She is an Alaskan bush pilot. Up to Fairbanks. Near downtown a lifted truck runs right into the back of another driving car. Liz gets scared by her shadow. At around 2 we leave to look for lights, but no luck.<br><br>Relaxy morning. Aurora Crepes & Peeking Duck for a peeking duck crepe. Shopping for a swimsuit, jewelry and alcohol. A bit of relax at the house and then to Pagoda. This is the imagined American-Chinese restaurant of my dreams. The decor is gaudy and 100% in. I am nostalgic for this thing. A thing I'm not sure I ever actually experienced. I'm reminded of tiki. They bring a hot pot of yummy tea. We share a massive combo meal of BBQ pork, egg rolls, fried shrimp, soup, sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, garlic shrimp, pork fried rice and fortune cookies. The meal kicks ass and there is so much left over. They give us a narrow branded tote that is just wide enough to stack Chinese food containers in. Into the wilderness. We try to feed a cat we spot off the side of the highway, but he wants nothing to do with us. Liz starts to spot a hint of green in the sky. We soon pull over and spend about twenty minutes being utterly dazzled by the pouring ribbons, dancing streams and gentle washes of green, red and purple. The tide recedes and we head on. Soon enough we catch another good course of waves. We then drive much deeper out. We camp off the side of the road for a few hours, but the sky, she blesses us no more tonight. Sleep.<br><br>Egg sandos. Chat with Mom. We drive southwest for two hours to Denali National Park. It's eerily quiet. The weather is chilly, but gorgeous. The sky is crisp. The sun at an angle that makes the whole day feel like near golden hour. We drive the thirty miles of road they have open. At regular intervals we pull off to take in the unbelievable views. At Mountain View we get out for a walkabout. We end up off trail and walk along a creek. In time it meets back up with the larger river and trail. The only wildlife we spot are two chubby Cino ravens who aren't quite ready to cuddle. Back to Fairbanks and Soba for badass Moldovan. Bors, meatball soup, Mamaliga and cabbage babies. Beer and sour cherry crepes to round it off. Bed and sleep for a bit. At 11:30 we headed back out for aurora chasing. On the big road we spot some wonderful sights. It's a bit cloudy, but not so much to completely obscure the lights. Onward to the big hill lookout, which provides the best views we've seen yet. The sky is huge here and we get about fifteen minutes of great dancing lights. After a solid wait we call it a night.<br><br>I get silly good crepes from next door. We spend most of the day in bed drinking beer & wine, watching SNL skits and munching on Chinese leftovers. In time we put on Apple Pie, which is absolute nonsense, but has some fun dancing in the end. Liz and I say hi to Aidy. Later, she'll say it was nice to chat with her...like when you're hiking and you see a bear, but it's two bears and they get along. To Chena Hot Springs. The road is snowy and scary. We pass a little fox friend out on a stroll. Signal is gone. We entertain one another by singing songs from memory. One Week goes surprisingly well. The pool is toasty, foggy and sulfuric. Very dark with minimal lighting. Boulders surround us. The floor is pebbles. She lies on the ramp, half in and half out; creme brulee in the bath. Snowflakes melt on her skin. Tiny cold kisses counter the stinging heat. On the way back the snow floats in goofy clumps. We stop the car and lean our heads out the window, looking to the sky. I realize that the tank is nearly empty and the car's estimate of what we have left is about six miles fewer than the distance to the nearest gas station. The next hour is focused as I attempt to conserve every ounce of gas in the tank. On each downhill I pop the car in neutral and let it propell us partially back up the other side. We overcome the differential and arrive at the station with 4 miles to spare. Relief. We treat ourselves with what Liz describes as the best Crunchwrap Supreme of her life.<br><br>Lunch of more crepes. Reuben and a crab. Walkabout. To the river. A duck is jumping up to grap berries hanging on a bush. We make him a little feast. Nice chats along the river as we spot beaver stumps. Eggnog latte. Hotel times for lie down and hot tub. We attempt a Polynesian place, but we are tricked. We fall back onto Papa John's plus more Field Recordings wine spritzers and two episodes of Ripley.	64.758637, -147.354757	Oct 5, 2024	Oct 10, 2024																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/H1qcKMAsySSTVguY7

Frekericksburg	Plunge	324	x	I drive the scenic route to Fredericksburg. Michael, Nancy, Mom, Mike, Justin, Danielle and Nixon are all there and hanging out already. I help them clean up leftovers of ribs and chorizo beans. Michael gives me a thorough tour of their incredible home. We take some guns out back and fire at some targets as the sun goes down. Mom and I have a nice chat. Justin and family head out and the rest of us settle in for some margaritas and catching up.<br><br>A nice easy morning of Wordle and connections. Around noon, Michael makes us blueberry pancakes. He then shows me all around the property. Nancy gives me some overalls and a cute workshirt. I climb the big tree and help Michael hang a new rope through his plunge pool cover pully. Nancy then gives me much cuter clothes. Mom, Mike and I head to Austin for some Lao smash burgers and other treats. I drop them off at J&D's. She has some lovely chute ready for us.	30.349509, -98.681806	Jul 5, 2024	Jul 7, 2024	Michael & Nancy, Mom & Mike, Justin & family																https://photos.app.goo.gl/9H3RfQVmitS9HZdk9
Greaty Smoky Mountains National Park	We Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies	323	x	We land at 1:30 a.m. and stay at the airport hotel.<br><br>We get up, get a car and head downtown. Our first stop is Potchke, a killer alternative Jewish deli. Lox bialy, pastrami Reuben, whitefish sandwich, potato blintz, green garlic babka, house fennel soda, coffee. I messaged Krystle earlier when I saw she was also in Knoxville today. We both happen to be in Pigeon Forge so we meet up at a Starbucks and catch up for a bit. Nextdoor to us is a mountain coaster, so Krystle, David and I roll down that while Liz and Devyn chat on rocking chairs. Hugs and a selfie before we part ways. Further east through Gatlinburg. Both of these towns are weird artificial Southern Vegas Disneyland hybrids. We drive for a good bit around there and the nearby mountains and then into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We get to the firefly area and chat with a kind park ranger. Up an in. We find a nice spot just off the trail and lay out the blanket. We cool off and relax for a few hours as the light fades. Liz yelps with excitement at the first flicker. It's another minute or two before we spot another. Here and there, slowly, they come to life. blink..blink..blink..blink..blink.................................. Repeat. Each guy dances to his own beat. A twinkling of stars. A room of fluorescent lights all flickering to life in their own way. Little patterns form. Chain reactions of three or four. Christmas lights running to the end of the string. You can spot the bold ones in the group. Those who start the slow clap. Mostly others join in, now in scores. It lasts a few seconds and they are done. Maybe one fella claps an extra beat, but he gets the signal. They pause and wait in darkness for the next round to begin. The light pulses in waves like this for the next few hours. Sometimes louder, sometimes quieter. Sometimes at 1 o'clock, sometimes behind us. We are surrounded by applause. A million mates. Doing the dance. Finding one another in the dar. It is We Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies.<br><br>A flight through the clouds.	35.651721, -83.581222	Jun 7, 2024	Jun 9, 2024	David, Krystle & Devyn																https://photos.app.goo.gl/BidqgBANkKRrTVtVA
Las Vegas	PRB	322	x	I shoot a 30-minute time lapse during the descent into Las Vegas. Public transit to the Golden Nugget. Like at Evelyn and Greg's wedding, we play the game of picking out who is here for the festival. It's not difficult. After a reset we scoot down to Cosmopolitan and sniff out Secret Pizza. It's stinkin' good. Back on the strip. The air is cool and the lights so pretty. We walk east for half an hour to Double Down Saloon. It's sort of a punk version of Frankie's and owned by the same folks. I fall asleep in the car ride back.<br><br>I wake up and realize the opal ring of Liz's I've been wearing is missing. It is almost certainly not in the room with us, but we ask the ghosts who flicker the lights to leave it by the TV (they decline the request). Big ol' cold brew and soon enough to the pool. It's sardines, but we nab two grooves. It's my first time out in affirming swimwear. It feels amazing. We order big frozen drinks. I dip my feet in the water and get chatting with Laura. In minutes we are sharing ourselves fully. We hug. Stupid sexy Christian chicken. Costume change and then to the Office of Collecting and Design for a reunion with Jessica and the two-hour flat lay experience Liz booked for us. She has created an amazing tiny wonderland and we get to let our minds play. I make a bowling explosion and Liz plays with appendages. We make Jessica blush with our dump truck of flattery. Back for a relax and to live out our garlic girl fantasy with rolls plus a calzone and a boli delivered to us. We get extra pretty and catch Dita Las Vegas. Beautiful as always. Brooke and Kate help us take some cute photos and talk art. Up to The Usual Place for some punk featuring Guitar Wolf. They are weird and wild. Now having seen them and Elvis' band I will make this statement about 80's Harajuku Rock 'n Roll: music is a vessel for antics, for gimmick. It's all gimmick. Flattery. Mockery to the extreme. To the extent that the gimmick becomes an art form all on its own. Harajuku fashion is the same. It takes only the surface level idea of whatever shipped over idea it saw and makes something entirely new out of it. Grunge is not grunge for itself, it is an aesthetic. As a kid I was taught wearing these identities as a costume made me a poser. But for them it's theatre. They lean in as far as possible and then still more. The show felt like it ended ten times. It was one big ending.<br><br>Big coffee and garlic girls in bed. Pool time for a few hours. It's gorgeous. Frozen drinks while we talk about love & support. Evelyn comes down. We give her violet candy and do the water slide. Monica joins. We talk weeny-tinis. Eventually we clean up. Evy brings us up to her's for a road rosé. She & Greg get us VIP access, though it's a bit confusing. We take in some punk and the punks. Filipino pork belly bowl and mac & cheese spring rolls. DEVO is a joy. Evy gets wristbands sorted and brings us up to the Old Man Bar. Liz notices were hanging a few feet from the singer of Gogo Bordello. Greg stops by for a few and then is off again. We part ways and consider another event, but these girls are dead and head to bed.<br><br>We checkout and walk east for 20 min where we meet Jessica (A.K.A. Dirk James), Teller & Maiko at a charming coffee shop. Deep connection immediately. We share ourselves and all of our transformations. To Co Anh for bun Cha and a yummy soup. A sunny walk to Golden Tiki for something like a Capri Sun and a Hi-C. Kim shares her love for Madness and gives us a sextet of custom poker chips she made just for today. Over to Stray Pirates for creamy fruity guys. Back at PRB I nap in the misty tent for a bit and get featured in @passedoutpunx. Gogol Bordello doesn't seem at all bothered by a pitiful sound mix. They are a joy. A 45-firework show. We get super close for Madness. Almost enough to drink from the sax player's bottle of wine he passes around. They feel a bit slow to start, but pick it up pick it up by the end. Our flight is cancelled so we get a cheap (non-pyramidal) room at Luxor.<br><br>Many flights cancelled. 	36.166960, -115.133897	May 24, 2024	May 28, 2024	Evelyn & Greg, Jessica & Teller																https://photos.app.goo.gl/YTzfwQBdP2Q5mur17
Hudson	Drone	321	x	We get in pretty late, pet the animals, chat a bit and sleep.<br><br>Sean makes us stupid good coffee. On the train downtown a woman is finger painting. A few folks down from her a man is playing dance music and seeing who will join in the groove. One person does. A man is screaming loudly near the tracks. To Russ and Daughters for lox sandwiches. We eat on the median. The lox is good. The bagels are fine. Next stop is La Cabra for cold brew and tomorrow pastries. Liz spots a yummy-looking taco shop, so tacos it is. They are indeed yummy. Onto Astor for some fun wines and amaro and then to Bel Fries for that. Back uptown. I am feeling quite overwhelmed and cry on the train back. I just manage to hold in a sob. We load the car and drive. Cori plays Anne Meredith and it hits good. We stop for Detroit pizza and killer dry lemon pepper wings in Poughkeepsie. Onward to Hudson. After dropping our stuff off we walk to a nearby bar for outdoor cocktails in beautiful weather. Back to the house for champagne on the stoop.<br><br>Breakfast sandwiches from Kitty's and onto Basilica. The building is an old warehouse. Maybe grain production. Birds flit among the rafters. We post up in a great spot against the wall. I feel comfortable and show my tum a bit. Above the performers is a chandelier of appendages holding jewels. The sound begins at 12. Every hour the people on stage morph into new people. The sound is a bath. Right now the water is electric. I drink tea and write my dream intent on a card. Flower pots. Harmonium. Taiko drum. Guitar. Saxophone. Voice. Accent. Vacuum-seal bag. Computer. Patch board. Bow. Gong. Tam Tam.<br><br>I sleep through a few artists. There are still a couple hours left, but we opt to hit the road straight to Superiority Burger. The cafe is quaint and feels like a time capsule of the 90's. My dream card falls into the toilet. Bloody Mary plus breakfast tray, burger, hash browns, chilaquiles, Rancho Gordo beans, sticky bun date shake. It's all beautiful. The weather is too so we stroll through Tompkins Square Park. Lots of folks out on the grass in swimwear. Sweet babes drive us up to LaGuardia. Direct doesn't work, but Nashville is open. We land and ride to Heather's. She has made a "Welcome Kayla + Liz" sign. I don't realize until later that this was deliberate and in reference to me telling the story about going to my brother's for Christmas. We meet Robbie and Betty and have some great chats. She feeds us spicy Szechuan fish and negronis. Everything is beautiful. Up at 3 to fly home.	42.251949, -73.798734	May 16, 2024	May 19, 2024	Sean & Cori																https://photos.app.goo.gl/XzWrkMgZW7bBELsN7
Slovenia	Flynn, Fairies & Franko	320	x	After picking up the car I hone my manual chops. I'm a bit rough at first and the engine gets a little smoky. In a little while we're in Mirabor. It's a steep, millennia-old town set on the banks of the river Drava. The sky is overcast and drizzling. We park on the far side of the river and walk across a tall bridge, taking in the beige facades and red rooves. The town is collegiate and sleeping. A young woman is dancing in the rain with her umbrella, evoking Gene Kelly. Down upon the bank, we spot a swan with a half dozen cygnets plodding behind her. I get low to snap shots. In a few minutes the little fuzz balls take an interest in me and waddle right up to the camera. Magic. The mother hisses at passing dogs, but seems content enough with me. After a bit more aimless strolling we make for Ljubljana. Gas, groceries and accommodations. They upgrade us to a gorgeous suite. Wine, salads and chocolate for dinner.<br><br>Bright and early, after hotel breakfast and extra naps, we drive to Lake Bled. There is a castle built high up on a sheer rock, a la Dracula, and a church on an island in the middle of the lake. It is Slovenia's only island. After a loop around the lake we park near a boat ramp and soon catch a ride with a paddling man over to the island. He gives us 45 minutes to explore and take pretty pictures before paddling us back. Liz knows of another pretty lake, so we make for that. It is called Bojonjsko Jezero and it is indeed pretty. The sun is nearing the mountain tops so we sit on the bank and watch it fade behind the clouds. Into Ljubljana. London is still weighing on us so we attempt at healthy looking vegan restaurant, but alas they closed early. Fortunately we passed a delicious looking Turkish spot on the way. We split a falafel plate and a doner kebab. It was indeed delicious. We grab a bottle of red from a local shop and return home for that plus chocolate and Chef's Table.<br><br>We clean up and hit the road towards Piran, a tiny peninsula at the tip of Slovenia. The old town is not accessible by car, so we park nearby and catch a bus to the big white central oval. The first spot we find is Nika's Spot. She is an artist who makes small trinkets out of what looks like mostly driftwood. I get a cute pair of earrings. The sun is beating down so we mostly wander through the cool shady alleys to the tip of the land. The coast looks Tuscan. Trieste is visible in the distance. Liz finds a well-rated restaurant in a small square. We dine on calamari and grilled sea bream. After more wandering and finding a postcard for Mom we catch the bus again and drive north for two hours to...<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Hiša Franko</span><span class="list__item">This compound is nestled deep up a winding river valley.

We arrived to dinner at 7:40 and we don't head back to our room until 1:30.<br><br>A table of fruits, breads, jams & honey, granola, yogurt, and charcuterie is waiting for us when head downstairs. From there we explore the grounds, greet the cows and make friends with a few of the resident cats. On our way back down the valley we stop by the river. I skip stones and Liz makes a wildflower bouquet. Another couple hours on and we are in Novo Mesto, a historic town built above the steep rocky banks of another glacial river. The main city street is bustling, people are drinking spritzes and eating street food. We get a smash burger and an American Dog. I guess we're missing home. We fly back to London and get a hotel near the airport. We fly out early the next morning.	46.247259, 13.537807	May 8, 2024	May 11, 2024																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mi6bWBKLzabt77gi7
London	Flynn, Fairies & Franko	319	x	We get the 11 p.m. nonstop to Heathrow and fly east for eight hours. I eat most of the chicken dinner. In the middle of the flight I get incredibly flushed and queasy. I have difficulty even walking to the bathroom and feel like I might black out. I don't vomit, but after cooling off for a few feel pretty much back to normal.<br><br>Roy picks us up from the airport and drives us up to Jessica's house. Just our one way trip takes over two hours. His generosity is overflowing and humbling. We learn about his upcoming family holiday at a cottage in Devon and his love of driving. He says for just a few before heading out. We chat with her a bit and then soon meet Dave, her chef friend and lover. We all have a good chat. Liz presents the duvet and trio of Takis, which she enjoys. We have a bag of Twists waiting for us in the room. She shows us around the house and encourages Nelson to come out. Eventually I'm holding him in my arms while feeding him a meat tube. Before long we have the dinner that Jessica and Dave spent four hours preparing the day prior. It is a from-scratch massaman curry with beef and all the fixings. It is the best I've ever had. We move onto drinks, prosecco, honey margaritas and amaretto sours and then finish the night off with a stunning chocolate cake that Dave had made. We actually stay up for a couple more hours, until almost 2, watching cooking videos on YouTube.<br><br>I wake at 5 and write Liz a birthday card. In a couple hours she wakes, reads it and then we cuddle a bit. We laze around until at least 1 and then all meet up in the kitchen for more cake, banoffee pie, tea and Takis. To Starbucks for a clotted cream fudge cold brew and then over to Chris' house where Liz picks up a book she ordered. We chat for a few, pet the kitties, meet Jade and talk Tolkien. Chris shows me some of his recent figurines and tell me he's working on a Telvido statue AND THAT HE'LL SEND ME A COPY! To a charity shop for a quick look around and then to Stevenidge station. The station cat is not present today. Soon enough we're in our hip minimalist hotel in Leicester Square. We get dark for just a bit and then cute. To Bone Daddies for very good ramen and then up Piccadilly and a bus to Allie Pallie for Johnny Flynn. I stand next to Adam from Sex Education at the bar. Johnny and the River Band are beautiful. The space is old and crumbling, but the sound is great. His voice is cello magic. The harmonies are perfect and ethereal. Before each song a speaker tells part of a story. We ride buses south for thirty minutes to Three Sheets, a dim, bumpy club with yummy drinks. A few minutes south to 🔶🟥🔵. Beautiful men wear beautiful jumpsuits. There are not labeled bottles. Just clear glass and big industrial refrigerators. I get a Habanero, which just lists habanero and Campari. I received a coupe with a perfectly clear liquid and a small red cube of jelly stuck on the inside. The nose is intoxicating. It's the eponymous pepper amplified. Caractured. The first sip makes my eyes flutter. As does every following one. It is deep. Savory. Floral. Citrusy. Rich. Smooth. Complex. Simple. Not at all spicy. Wild. All of the cocktails are outstanding. As is the charcuterie board. Night bus home.<br><br>To Victoria Station for a coffee and pasty. On the cup they write my name 'Kayler'. So cute. I read Pig poems on the train. We walk through the chilly overexposed streets to Rachel's house. Her plus Amilee, Tommy and Tika are there to greet us. Fran arrives not long after. We catch up a bit in the living room and then Rach serves a beautiful Sunday roast lunch of chicken, potatoes, carrots, stuffing and Yorkshire pudding, all covered in gravy. Dessert is pavlova and delicious. We spend a good while back in the front room all catching up. Fran and the kids head out. We chat with Rach a bit longer and then she drops us off at the station. Back to the room where I sleep until 8:45. A quick tidy and then to Palomar for a meal of bread, labneh, falafel, anchovies, cabbage, strachietelli and polenta plus a couple glasses of pet nat. Back to bed. We wake at 1 p.m. and head to Darjeeling Express. The sign says 'closed', but I ask very nicely and they let us in. Asma greets us and gives a few recommendations, which we accept. Chili prawns, channa chaat, paneer korma and aloo paratha. It's all fantastic. Our server sees Liz clear the last bite of onion from a plate and expresses his gratitude. He shakes her hand and brings her a chai. We maybe ordered too much, but it is beautiful. Oxford Street shopping. A quick change at the hotel and then a bus to Straker's. We sit at the chefs bar. Crisp wines, flat bread with mussels, asparagus with egg salad, pasta with peas, sirloin and potatoes. Doughnies with creme fraiche for dessert. Down the road to Church Alarms for a cask ale and carpet.<br><br>Coffee and a mediocre pastry. We stop by Forbidden Planet and I pick up some queer manga. Then over to Pick & Cheese for lots of yummy bites with bubbles. Next we walk to the London Coliseum for the stage production of Spirited Away. The show is unreal. Incredible set pieces, costumes and music. To Tesco for chocolate and treats. A quick stop for a pastel de nata. Drop off stuff at the hotel and then to Convent Garden where we meet Helen. I'm enamored by the skills of a balancing juggler, so we stay to watch the finale before heading off to find a pint. We settle on The Sun, which has a boring name for a pub, but is otherwise pleasant. We jump right into sharing and have a good catch up. Hannah arrives, we snack on some chips and soon head to Bancone. Orange blossom negronis, focaccia and some decent pastas. More good chatting and then off to Befordshire for the lot of us.<br><br>Bright and early to Heathrow. Bacon butties in the lounge. We both sleep soundly on the flight.	51.898907, -0.196097	May 3, 2024	May 8, 2024	Roy, Jessica & Dave, Rachel, Fran, Helen, Hannah																https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mi6bWBKLzabt77gi7
Las Vegas	First Time	318		We are here for Fred's 50th birthday. Liz and I stay with Mom & Fred in a Bellagio suite. Andy & Mae and Justin & Danielle are also here. We go to Batista's for a good time dinner.<br><br>Breakfast is massive pancakes at Hash House A Go Go. We walk around the strip a bit. Liz and I go shopping and I buy a fun funky shirt from Ben Sherman.	36.110000, -115.169212	Jun 1, 2011	Jun 2, 2011	Mom & Fred, Justin & Danielle, Andy & Mae																
Willamette Valley	Barrels & Booths	317	x	We get a brand new Ford Explorer. Downtown to Little T American Baker for and Italian meat sandwich, a ham and cheese in pretzel baguette and coffee. Into Ota Tofu for a few blocks for the Booths and some fried slabs for us. We eat the slabs immediately outside. The skin is pleasantly tough and chewy. The flesh meaty, rich and nutty. Liz plugs McMinnville and we head south. In about an hour we're strolling the high street on a gorgeous day. The shady side of the street is dreamy perfect weather. Waffle cones are baking next to the car. Every few storefronts is a wine room. After doing a lap and picking up a magnifying glass for Marlow we settle into the Chris James room for a flight. We pick up a few bottles of the most delicious stuff and head towards the Booths. They've already had dinner so we detour into Beaverton for Afuri ramen, which is good, but not Japan good. To the Booths' home for hanging and chatting into the night. Ryan teaches us some kiddo lingo like "Sticking my gyat (butt) out the window for the Rizzler (person with charisma)".<br><br>Amy makes me a cardamom coffee and Ryan a yummy breakfast. The we go on a walk and look for leprechaun feathers in the hidden forest behind their home. Marlow gives Liz a picture she just drew of her covered in bunnies. To Dos Hermanos for chopped salad sandwiches and pull-apart sourdough loaves for later. Through the mountains for two hours and we're at Cannon Beach. I walk barefoot in the firm damp sand. It's just a bit chilly and breezy. There are massive stone structures just beyond the breaking waves. They are deposits from volcanic eruptions. I think I see a human at the top of the haystack deposit. Liz says it's a bird. Upon closer inspection she is correct. Not only is it a bird, it is a bald eagle. We pose for a few piccies and talk about change on the way back to the car. Forty minutes up the coast and across a big bridge and we're in Astoria. We missed the Sunday shops so straight to Dead Man's Isle for us. Madeline is running the place today and is super lovely. We sit at the bar and order a mega volcano bowl plus spam fried rice and gochujan tots. The bowl is beautiful and delicious. Liz spots Miles and says hello. He takes us upstairs for a tour of the Golden Gai bar that will open in just a few days. It's filled with esoteric Japanese collectibles. We round it off with a mango flip that Liz notes is surprisingly reminiscent of a key lime pie. Two hours through the woody mountains and we're back with the Booths. After a short chat they're off to bed and Liz and I take a dip in the hot tub. The water is warm, the evening cool and stars are shining. We sleep great.<br><br>Morning hang times and we're off. To Bernstein's Bagles. Liz discovers we just so happened to park in front of Kyler Martz's art studio. He has a bunch of super cool stuff up in the window. Some yummy fishy bagels and then to Ota for road tofu. To the Marshall's by the airport. No luck for Liz, but I get some active gear. At the airport we use our Priority Pass credit for a whisky cocktail flight. We get a bit drunk and reminisce on cheeky memories. To Capers for a chanterelle burger and shrimp tacos.	46.188163, -123.829878	Mar 16, 2024	Mar 18, 2024	The Booths	Portland, Willamette Valley, Cannon Beatch, Astoria		45.210122, -123.192523	45.565607, -122.831765	45.884040, -123.968726	46.188163, -123.829878										https://photos.app.goo.gl/PY9S5VTi9YDFDNfJ8
Montreal	Love Shack	316	x	Ryan greets me at the airport while I'm waiting to use the family restroom that never opens up. He is carrying somewhere between fourteen and twenty pounds of meat in a Styrofoam box. We get a ride to the hotel for a quick clean up and then another ride to PDC. Ryan drops off half of the meat and then orders a shot of house made jalapeno vodka, a shot of jalapeno vodka with St. Germain and a shot of Jameson in quick succession. Emil, Ryan's "son" hangs with us a bit. He is a Quebecoise Ryan and they're sweet and flirty. Another ride to Atwater for a genie lamp, a really smoky drink, plus four other less visually distinctive drinks. We pass through an impressively large industrial area to <span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Le Serpent</span><span class="list__item">There is a man by the door with beautifully messy hair</span><span class="list__item">White burgundy </span><span class="list__item">Warm oyster with dill, basil, garlic and saba</span><span class="list__item">Trio of crudo.

Back to PDC for more flirting, chartreuse, absinthe, fauxjitos, foie poutine, scallop crudo with pickled shallot and a scallop mousse rolled with pasta, black truffle and citrus butter. This place is special. Ryan has a heartwarming connection with the staff. I've never seen anything like it. He knows intimate details of their lives and they his. They all seem to genuinely care for one another. We walk home for thirty minutes through the not-terribly-cold night and talk about Nuckles. It feels a bit like 2013 Brooklyn.<br><br>I sleep soundly until it's time to get ready. Ryan picks up the car and we meet him out front. Liz wants to check out a giant orange ball on the way out of town so we pop in and grab a yummy Orange Julip. Ryan drives us west for about and hour. He points out the various sugar shacks plus their accompanying apple orchards and tapped maple tree networks connected by blue webs of drip lines. Soon we arrive at <span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Cabane à Sucre Au Pied De Cochon</span><span class="list__item">After appreciating the maple trees up close we head into the cozy space and settle in.

An older man tells us in French about the maple evaporators we're eyeing in the kitchen. Ryan informs us it's Martin's brother. We drive back, drop off the car downtown and walk back to the hotel. It's only a ten-minute walk and I'm heavily layered, but it's cold enough out make my fingers ache. Ryan teaches us about curse words here being religious words like 'tabernac'. Back to the room for relaxing, Triple D and Nat Geo. Our informative driver tells us about clubs for young people, clubs for people our age, and rising rent in the city.<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Mon Lapin</span><span class="list__item">We sit at the bar and Ryan gives the chef a lot of meat.</span><span class="list__item">Sparkling wine</span><span class="list__item">Autumn bastard bread with butter in a pond of oil</span><span class="list__item">Sea razor clams, chili roulette</span><span class="list__item">More wine</span><span class="list__item">Fried chicken oysters</span><span class="list__item">White fish crudo on smoked tomato water with brown butter </span><span class="list__item">Canned leeks</span><span class="list__item">Homemade salt and pepper chips</span><span class="list__item">Dehydrated and rehydrated smoked carrots on mussel sauce with pollen</span><span class="list__item">Lamb tartare with Castelvetrano</span><span class="list__item">Shallot strudel topped with foie blond</span><span class="list__item">Funky and sour Beaujolais </span><span class="list__item">Spinach gnocchi </span><span class="list__item">Clams in sherry with trumpets of death and crispy sunchokes</span><span class="list__item">Sour cherry sorbet with rice pudding and a heart of smoky praline</span></span>Dimitri, our wonderful somme and server gives us Gatorade-themed Mon Lapin pins.

I buy a hat and Ryan a shirt.<br><br>In the room we eat cold leftovers with plastic forks. The chickpea soup is gelatinous. Hugs and off to the airport. 	45.572151, -74.052764	Feb 23, 2024	Feb 25, 2024	Ryan Isemeyer																https://photos.app.goo.gl/2hyo1G1s1krqNF9P6
Houston	Much Better	315	x	After a pee and Korean jerky from Bucees we drive through the oil refinery district along the coast until we come to a boardwalk & marina town which, apparently, is home to the best burger in America. It is damn good. Not yet sure if it's better than Sky Rocket though. Our next stop is the Museum of Fine Arts where we get in for free and take in a Turrell hallway, Kusama Infinity Room, a Turrell wedge room, plus a lot of other great paintings and sculptures. Around closing time we wander the sculpture garden. I climb a long outdoor staircase and take in the city in the last moments of golden hour. We nap for a bit at the hotel and, at 9:30 head to Trash Panda Drinking Club for Brussels sprouts, birria pizza (with consomme for the crust) plus some very good drinks. I discover the term "tipflation". While looking for parking in the neighborhood behind Lei Low I notice steep ditches and remark that it must be common for cars to fall in. We then immediately see a car that just fell in. They are okay though. Inside at the bar we get some pretty good drinks featuring tiki butter. The bartender seems to have little patience with the woman sitting next to us who at one point asks him what kind of frog he would be if he could be any type of frog. Back to the hotel for face and eye masks.<br><br>We don't even bother with hotel breakfast, but make straight for coffee. Liz gets a halva latte and I an iced orange spice one plus a croissant. Next to the science museum. We also get in for free because of our BofA cards. Our first stop is a Focault Pendulum where we spend probably twenty minutes in rapt focus watching the next sacrificial wooden peg rotate, along with us and the rest of the Earth, imperceivably closer to the relatively gargantuan swinging metal ball. It's a triumph when it knocks it down. Onward to the paleontology hall. Microbial mats, trilobites, jellyfish, garfish, stegosaurus, diplodicus, allosaurus, tyrannosaurus Rex, triceratops, megalodons, gargantuan pterodactyls, giant sloths, sabertooth tigers, woolly mammoth, apes. The hall is the best paleontology how we've ever seen. The structures are immaculate and caught in live action. The lighting is artful. The space takes you through a journey. The descriptions are visceral and compelling and grotesque. This museum was built on the decomposed bodies of the creatures we are admiring. Upstairs. A sobering and stunning look at the quickly-disappearing Texas wildlife. Birds and snakes and cats and possums and armadillos and black bears and bison. Next through the cabinet of curiosities; the proto museum. We try to speed things up, but then we hit the seashell exhibit and are nearly brought to tears at the sheer beauty present. Some have bright vivid colors. Some have elegant mysterious shapes. Some have fractal patterns that draw you in. Some look like snails riding on top of a magic carpet. Finally the gem hall. We knew it would be amazing and we still weren't prepared. The colors. The shapes. The structures. There's so much variety and beauty in them. I realize I know very little about how gems are formed. I can't wrap my head around how these shapes come to be. I know it's based off of the molecular structure, but it's just mind-boggling to really try to comprehend how that becomes these towers and shapes and blocks and fine hairs stuck out like a sea urchin. It's thoughtfully lit and feels more like being in an art gallery than a museum. We are good and hungry now and head to crawfish and noodles for lunch. Recruited by a young woman with a charming personality. She encourages us to play footsie under the table. We order black and pepper deep fried blue crab, a fish sauce chicken wings, turkey next to, and Cajun fries. It's all very good. She comes back to the table a few times and we get chatting some more. Her name is Taylor. She's the daughter of the owner and oversees their marketing, but she's supporting the front of house today. Her older brother, Corey, it's the chef. At one point she brings him out to meet us and he comes out with a tray full of live crabs for us to ogle at. We share pet photos. Taylor comments that it is such a cool coincidence that we are all here. I agree Taylor, I agree.	29.722015, -95.389562	Feb 3, 2024	Feb 4, 2024																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/HYiGUrPD1JD4yY7W8
Las Vegas	24 & Tits	314	x	Grandpa's spaghetti with the Miller family. Catherine stays late for a very good chat.<br><br>Coffee with Casey. Curry and crossword with Anne & Richard.<br><br>We drive to Vegas. Thai dinner in the hotel. Silver Sevens and Freemont to spend money. Really good pizza at Evel Pie.<br><br>Hotel biscuits and gravy. We head down to the arts district for coffee and delicious pizza at Good Pie. I check out a few vintage shops and Buffalo and pick up a few cute items. We walk down to Frankie's for a less smoky but still smoky round of drinks and then make back to the hotel for a quick clean up. Back together in group form we head to Golden Tiki for wonderful drinks, yummy snacks and mediocre lounge singing. Back to the hotel for an outfit change, drinks and Sequence. We try getting a ride for the one-mile walk, but traffic is so bad we get out halfway through and walk the rest. The show is a joy. So many amazing set pieces. So many good artists. So many boobs and bulges. Several times platforms lower from the ceiling revealing bonus burlesque. After the show we hang around the lobby and chat it up with a few of the male dancers plus Jett Adore and Dirty Martini.<br><br>Breakfast and flights. Getting out of Vegas is not easy so David and I head to Phoenix while Liz goes through Austin. I watch Saltburn. In Phoenix we sit in a cramped lounge and eat BBQ chicken sliders.	36.158055, -115.153777	Dec 28, 2023	Jan 1, 2024	Anne & Richard, David	Phoenix, Las Vegas															https://photos.app.goo.gl/kUZpHz5CCTFszVUF6
Puerto Vallarta	Expensive Tequila	313	x	A smooth-talking lady at the airport charms us and gives us a fair bit of alcohol to drink. We book a very reasonably priced snorkeling tour in exchange for going to her timeshare sales pitch in the morning. At the Westin, we get upgraded to a nice nice room with a view. After some downtime we walk to the marina and dine at Victor's. The marlin burrito is especially yummy. We're both pretty wiped so we do a John Wilson and sleep.<br><br>At 9, the woman meets us and we get in a cab for the "seventy-five minute presentation"...over four hours later we finally emerge with our bottle of tequila, snorkeling tour and no timeshare contract. We did get "ladies" a few times though, which was very affirming. They drop us off downtown. We stroll the pier and make for a spot specializing in birria. It's pretty good, but still no Chopper. Liz spots an alligator swimming in the river below us. We explore the beach, walk the flea market, greet some kitties and stroll the quaint cobblestone streets before getting a taxi to the hotel. After a rest we walk down to the marina where there is a night market underway. One stand has chipotle elote, so we do that. Soon we spot a guy selling cochinita pibil. He lets us taste some on a chip and I experience multiple levels of satisfaction; this is the best I've ever had. We get some on tostadas. Next we do elote cheesecake, which is kind of weird and neat. Our last stop in the market is to buy two printed microfiber towels from a very talented and committed photographer. He makes me want to get a smaller camera. Next we pick up some goodies from Oxxo and watch two episodes of John Wilson.<br><br>We get up pretty early and head down to the buffet. After I get hot food they inform Liz that our ticket only allows for the cold bar. We taxi to the marina terminal for the snorkeling cruise. We're informed it starts an hour later than we were told. When they do eventually start loading us on, we see that they are packing scores of people onto a pretty bare bones and exposed boat. I'm starting to wonder if this will not be on par with other snorkeling cruises we've done in the past. Liz does a quick search and immediately finds reviews calling this company a total scam and describing the tours as "disastrous" and "torture". We cut our losses and get the hell out of there. Reading more reviews does indeed highlight that we would have had an absolutely terrible day on this scam barge. After a mandatory bed break, we slide down to the first level and play some ping pong for a bit. Next we pool. I'm a definitely at the point now where I need to wear a top. I'm feeling a bit anxious about all of it, but I do walk and swim around for a bit. That was difficult for me to do. We order margaritas, get a choccy banana and later get tacos from a little stand by the pool. After another bed session and a John Wilson we attempt dinner. The birria place we were thinking to try will close soon and we're not finding any cabs, so we opt to stay on site. We end up at the fancy restaurant on the beach, but manage to have a pretty awesome meal of super soft bread with bleu cheese, onion rings with Roquefort, ribeye tacos with bone marrow and fries at a quite reasonable price. Back in bed for beers, fake Pringles and JW.<br><br>Down to the beach for some good wave play, sand toes and sunny legs. After checking out we ride downtown and pop into Pepe's for crispy pastor tacos, cheesy grilled onions, mango margarita and michelada. We stroll the beach for just a few but the sun is in a sadistic mood. Back to the airport for us.	20.657533, -105.249677	Dec 13, 2023	Dec 16, 2023																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/duwdqqoZusdCaoTu5
Detroit	Aqua	312	x	A man sitting across from me on the plane is watching porn. I look over a minute later and see him jerking off under his coat. We tell a flight attendant and, when we land, a cop comes to escort him off. I tell them what happened. They don't arrest him. We get a car and head to Frita Batidos in Ann Arbor for a coconut milkshake, cuban burgers, shoestring fries, loaded plantains and a thick mocha. We head to the hotel and crash for a few hours. Then we get pretty and go to Shield's pizza for a couple stretchy yummy rectangles. To downtown to AQUA. They are a blast. To Mutiny for forgettable cocktails and then to bed.<br><br>Coffee and leftover Cuban for breakfast. We make for Anthology, for a superlative oat milk cortado and coffee soda plus a big bag of beans. From there we drive through Eastside Market and downtown. It's too cold to stop and walk around, but the view is good nonetheless. We're not quite pizzad out yet so we go to Pie Sci for a tasty orange chicken pie. Back to the airport and home.	42.337801, -83.051739	Dec 10, 2023	Dec 11, 2023																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/iVJBJ5yvwhq4FhE16
Oklahoma City	Bones	311	x	A nice drive up. First stop is the Museum of Osteology for a really wonderful collection of bones and information. Also they have a house can named Indiana Bones who we got to pet. We stop by the hotel to drop off our stuff and then off to Barkeep for some delicious cocktails. We also get some beautiful amber glasses and Liz a fun Dracula Negroni shirt. Next onto Ma Der for an absolutely killer Lao dinner if crispy rice, sticky rice, jerky, fermented cabbage, red curry fried chicken, beef skewers and funky cocktails. We drop the car off at the hotel, Liz sneaks in a quickie and then we're off to Flamingo Tiki Room for some not amazing tiki drinks. The woman next to us is super friendly and we get chatting for a while. She is Brittany and he is Two Eagles. We close down Flamingo and they invite us to a nearby bar. There is a bar cat! Liz is happy. A drunken bro nearly gets in a fight. I think then the cops come for him. More hanging and chatting with them and then goodnight.<br><br>Up an to Eote for coffee and kolache. It's very busy and just okay flavor wise. Next to Haydeh's for supposedly the best gyro in Oklahoma. I can't speak to that, but it didn't come close to the one we tried in Mesquite. Over to Adam's house to chat for a bit and pick up a couch and then back down to Dallas.	35.364799, -97.441841	Nov 4, 2023	Nov 5, 2023	Indiana Bones																
Moorea	Something Old, Something New	310	x	Liz finds us a banh mi stand to pick up some treats and we take them to a nearby beach to ingest. A nice bun and something they called a tofu Vietnamese taco, but I would call a cruchwrap supreme loaded with fries and honey mustard. I roll up my pants and wade in the shallow sandy water. Under some coral I spot what I think is an octopus, but we eventually learn is a Spotted Worm Sea Cucumber. It pokes its little vacuum cleaner head out and ends up stretching over two feet out beyond the rock. We can see there is still much coiled under the rock so he must be a big boy. We hit the Super U for some groceries and make for the house. It is nested deep and up in Opunohu Bay. The house is a perfect beachy foresty bungalow with a wrap around deck that overlooks a lush downhill grade into the inlet and then up the other side to jagged peaks of juicy green canapy and black rock that dissolve into mountain scraped clouds. Selma shows us around and gives us a fat loaf of banana bread. We're all pretty tuckered so we zonk out for a few hours. We come to, have some drink and cook up delicious sausage with sweet potatoes. After table chatting we're zonked again and say good night.<br><br>A very productive morning of snacking we make our way out. Our first stop is Belvedere Lookout, a high point on the island that is on the rim of the volcano crater. It overlooks the valley of the crater and offers a spectacular view of both bays. Down from there we lunch at Snack Mahana. We sit in a little hut right on the water and dine on breaded mahi mahi with coconut milk plus, of course, poisson cru. It is fantastic. We see another worm cucumber plus a ton of regular cucumbers, fish, a long needle boy and a shark. Around the cove a bit more to a public beach with only a very narrow strip of sand. I get in to snorkel, but the waves are a bit rough for comfort and good visibility. After taking in the not-so-sun a bit more we continue around the island, stopping regularly to admire the astonishingly beautiful views. Liz gives us the very good idea to stop by the macaron stand where we enjoy some passion fruit mango and caramel delights with tea and coffee. After winding out way back around the island we retreat to the house. It is cool and rainy. We turn of all the lights and watch the sky slowly turn blue, then deep purple, then black. Silhouettes of craggy mountain tops and palm fronds blend into the rain. We sautee onions, eggplant, taro and shrimp with a coconut pulp sauce for supper.<br><br>The night is cool and rainy, as is the morning. Tea and treats to wake us up. Anne and Richard are feeling more of a relaxing day so Liz and I head out on our own to the beach. Fortunately, the rain tapers off and we're left with an increasingly gorgeous day. We take turns snorkeling. There's a stunning variety of fish in the water. Lots of neon stripes. From there we wander on. The Thai food truck we want to try is closed. Nothing else looks particularly appetizing so we just grab stuff from the store. There is a Route des Ananas that connects the two bays via an inland road so we give it a go. It's not too pretty, but connects us back up to the Belvedere road, so we nip up for another view before coming home. A bit of snacking and the Millers are ready to head out. Back to the beach for some nice views and doggo pets while the sky turns dark. Our neighbors drew a big penis in the sand. Back at the house Liz and Anne cook up a yummy dinner of rice noodles with pork, mushroom and the kitchen sink in a Polynesian sauce.<br><br>I awake with good energy and decide to hike Magic Mountain. The whole thing is paved and takes about 25 minutes to get up, but it's brutally steep. The view is worthy. Back and pack and check out. Up Belvedere again for the clearest skies we've seen yet. A bit down from that is an archeological site. We hike down through the tropical forest. It is a raised floor build with evenly stacked, fuzzy green stones. We stop at Le Pa'i Hot for cocktails, stir fry shrimp, club sandwiches and a banana flambée. Towards the end of the meal we get a very good and loud rain. More counterclockwising around the island. We kill our last bit of time at a beach dipping our toes into the water, cleaning up broken glass and pspspsing cats before we get the ferry to the plane to the plane home.	-17.506177, -149.850914	Oct 24, 2023	Oct 29, 2023	Anne & Richard	Tahiti, Moorea		-17.496795, -149.494410	-17.506177, -149.850914												https://photos.app.goo.gl/izyfwkGBeoEWHXHg7
Tahiti	Something Old, Something New	309	x	I kiss babies on their heads and Tony gives me a ride to the port. A cleaning woman yells "Chica! Chica!" to warn me that I'm going into the men's restroom. I land in LAX, eat a $20 grilled cheese and meet Anne. Before long we're on our flight to Tahiti. Hertz didn't have a car when we landed so we get a taxi to the residence and wind down. Soon enough we're up and out. We walk to Papeete Market, a big open air market with lots of stalls, by tuna plus a bunch of veggies to cook up for tonight. After that we find a little cafe nearby and have some lunch. I have poisson cru avec coco and Anne has an American breakfast. After a bit of wandering Anne mentions the idea of renting a scooter, which we investigate and find that there's some pretty awesome electric scooters we can rent. It takes a little while but we get it sorted and now have some wheels. Back to the house to put the stuff in the fridge and relax for a bit. At around 4:00 we get up and drive east to Venus Point where we hang for a couple of hours and watch the beautiful sunset over Moorea. We cruise back through the dusk and cook up the groceries at the house. I try to stay up, but am wiped and had to bed shortly after.<br><br>I wake up early and go out for a morning scooter ride through the industrial district and look at the seawall. I then head inland and find more industrial areas. At the top of the road is an abandoned cement truck that's being overgrown with ivy. I have some tea with Anne and then return the scooter to pick up a car. Once we're together again we head east along the main road. Our first stop is one of the gorgeousest waterfalls I've ever seen. As we're driving into the valley we put on the Jurassic Park theme song, which is the most appropriate thing I could imagine hearing right now. We hike a good bit to see two more less-impressive-but-still-very-impressive waterfalls. Along the way tiny iridescent rainbow lizards enchant us. Back at the parking lot we chow down on two chunky, perfectly ripe, juicy, carroty and dare I say slightly herbaceous mangoes. My legs are dripping. Good thing I changed out of my white linen pants before the hike. We continue down the east road. We encounter a resting point to allow a construction crew to do their thing. It's a great opportunity for Anne and I to bond. Soon enough we reach the eastern end. Here is a sleepy beach with girls in t-shirts practicing something I'm sure they don't call hula dancing. Silky black sand between my toes. Hazelnut in my tum. The pizza place in the island waist town is shuddered, but we both secretly wanted McDonald's anyway. The girl laughed when I asked if they had honey mustard. Back up the western side. Lots of pretty glassy water and misty green mountains. At the grotto we find some funky flowers and stay for a very mellow sunset over the serene water. Back at the house we dine on more tuna banana coconut soup.<br><br>I return the small car and get a bigger car. By the store for some groceries and cough syrup for Anne. We drive back down the western coast and check out a public beach. We find ourselves a nice shady spot and settle down. Anne brought a snorkel mask so we take turns exploring the absolutely stunning sea life. In just a few minutes with my head below the surface I see probably a hundred different types of fish. I am swimming around a massive dentists office fish tank. A bit further down the road we stop into a very posh beach bar with an incredible view of Moorea. I drink a mocktail and we snack on various yummy bites. Our next stop is to pick up Liz and Richard at the airport. Big hugs. After a quick feet up at the house we hit the road to Venus Point just in time for a pretty, though nonspecific sunset. After a beer run we make for the food truck caravan where we dine on grilled fish and chicken plus some mandatory poisson cru. Back home for beers and sleepy time.<br><br>Up an on the ferry to Moorea.	-17.496795, -149.494410	Oct 21, 2023	Oct 24, 2023	Anne & Richard	Tahiti, Moorea		-17.496795, -149.494410	-17.506177, -149.850914												https://photos.app.goo.gl/izyfwkGBeoEWHXHg7
Austin	Lotta Flaca Ninas	308	x	After work we drive south for I think four hours and meet the crew at Meanwhile, a big outdoor brewery with lots of food trucks and a live band. We nab the last slices of pizza, sip cucumber collins and catch up with Michael, Lindsay, Anthony, Matt, Ben, Gina, Caleb and more. A bad Macca. A smaller group meets nearby at Little Drinks for a final round. At around midnight we check into Gian's place.<br><br>I walk to ThoroughBread for coffee and and a beautiful half-baked cookie. For lunch we head to KG BBQ for Egyptian Texas fare like pomegranite-glazed ribs and BBQ lamb belly. We buy nothing from a few vintage shops, clean up and Liz drops me off at the venue so I can take some photos with the boys. We talk, we listen, we cry, we dine, we party, we dance. After the party there is another party where we dance some more.<br><br>ThoroughBread again for brisket thorito and a gooey banana nutella cookie. We chat with Alison for a bit and head to a macrobiotic kitchen for lunch. The food is awesome and healthy. A group at the table behind us are sending light energy into willing participants. We all three have a go at it. I'm not sure I feel anything in particular, but it is nice to be still. Next we head to another brewery to meet with some stragglers for a good bit and then make the drive back.	30.208653, -97.729689	Sep 29, 2023	Oct 1, 2023	Anthony, Michelle, Michael, Pat, Matt, Matt, Caleb, Pabba, Ben and many more.																
Chattanooga	Homecoming	307	x	We get in very late.<br><br>We work all day. Chicken Parm and wine for lunch. After work Devyn makes us black margaritas and then an Aviation. His chops have gotten very good. Krys makes a roasted parsnip apple soup with melted gruyere on homemade wheat sourdough. Then a sweet potato salad with mustard garlic vinaigrette paired with perfectly seared garlicky steaks. We're not sure why exactly, but Prissy is not in favor of us being here or trying to touch her. We do anyway.<br><br>Coffee & yummy donuts. We drive down to Ruby Falls, which is a pretty cave with a big waterfall about a half a mile in it. We head downtownish to Main Street Meats, where we dine on gumbo with potato salad, biscuits & gravy, a Reuben sandwich, a burger, a steak, and a ham, cheese & jam sandwich. Niedlov's for coffee. To downtown for umbrellas and silly photoa. We walk to the super cute Dwell Hotel and visit their bar, Matilda Midnight, for some delicious drinks. Next to Unknown Caller for a few rounds of drinks plus a whole lot of 90's trivia. A charcuterie board at the house sounds so far away, so we stop at a nice pizza shop and get a food neopolitian with N'djuja and honey. Then to bed.<br><br>I finish An Amerikan Family, eat a donut and have a good talk with Krys. Devyn makes breakfast tacos using the leftover steak from the other night. We cross the state line to Georgia and check out Grumpy's antique store. Krys finds some vinyl and Christmas ornaments. Back at the house, Liz picks up Prissy, who doesn't hiss immediately, we share a charcuterie counter and Devyn takes us back to the airport.	35.116735, -85.041930	Sep 21, 2023	Sep 24, 2023	Krystle & Devyn																https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z8ZPP8H2X5qjv3MZA
Guanajauto	Wining and Dining	306	x	I watch The Bear on the flight.<br><br>Good chilaquiles and bad bacon for breakfast. After some good spooning we hail a taxi and scoot to Guanajuato. En route, we drive through a series of underground tunnels, complete with intersections. We ascend into the the very charming, colorful, colonial town. It is hilly here and the buildings are painted in many bright colors. We meet up with Rob and Tony at the Don Lucas hotel and soon head for a stroll. The brick-lined streets are narrow and and shady with trees. It feels closer to San Marino than anything I imagined Mexico to look like. I get regular peeks down streets of the house-lined mountains, which is reminiscent of Valparaiso. There is a big church and then a shady, restaurant-perimetered square. It is sunny and 78°. Bands are playing competing Norteño and Mariachi. High at the top of a mountain is a large statue of what looks like a Roman god. Tony leads us through a maze of streets. Men dressed in pseudo-Shakespearian garb encourage us to participate in their troubadour-led bar crawl. We find a similarly shady restaurant-perimetered square and sit down for some micheladas and a platter of meat. After hanging there for a good while we explore the mercado. Rob tells us he's been coming here since before Liz was born and that it hasn't changed at all. I buy some earrings that are molcajete. More wandering and the back to the hotel for siestas. In a few hours we wake and head to their room for a glass of wine. Rob is craving pozole so we head out in search. We find a very cross laden establishment and get that plus some other classic Tex Mex fare. More wandering and then heladlo on a stick. We're all wiped, so off to bed for us.<br><br>I wake up early to the sound of our AC unit taking a big wee on the floor. Downstairs for coffee. Soon we're out and heading up the funicular. The view is stunning, as is the esquiche. I am very tempted by beaded jewelry. Back down, an orchestra is performing in the center park, so we sit and enjoy Boody Marys while we listen. Later, a less sophisticated marching band carrying a bust of Jesus toots on by. Onward to the Diego Rivera museum. We spent probably 90 minutes taking in some great art. Well worth the $2 entry. When we walk out we find R&T seated in a restaurant across the street. It's a small, charming, queer-friendly spot. I get a jug of delicious pulque, which is reminiscent of kombucha. We snack on cuitlacoche quesadillas and drenched tortas. A girl is making a quinceanera video via drone on the steps of the museum. Siestas. We stroll the streets in search of food. We initially set out for pizza, but determine Mexican is probably our best bet. Hot dogs seem to be a big deal here. We decide to try the molcajete Liz saw the other night just in front of the hotel. We're in the big square in front of the church. The barrage of stimulus is constant. People asking/selling. Competing Mariachi bands. Impersonators. Dogs. The food is fine. Back to the hotel for a bottle of red and Juanga.<br><br>Breakfast. We're still tired and go lie back down. Eventually I come to and decide to walk. I head up the windy steps and, before long, I'm at the Pipila statue. I get the cute earrings I saw yesterday and walk further up the mountain to meet the guys at a hotel bar. We drink Bloody Marys and talk about the history of this place. Tony points out the building that is the site of the first battle in the Mexican War of Independence. The place where Pipila strapped a stone slab to his back to block the conquistadors' gunfire and crawled up to torch the door. Back down in the Jardin, I reconvene with Liz, share a slice of cheesecake, meet back with the guys and stroll. We buy a cute bowl. Further on we are tempted by a Japanese restaurant. We dine on bento and sushi. We attempt to get a free chomurro at the square, but it's not on offer. To Van Gough for beers. Many musicians serenade us.  It's now been a little while since the trip. I'm trying to remember everything, but it's a little bit guessy from here. We head back for a bit of a siesta. We meet back up and head to a restaurant next to the crossy one. They serve bread rolls and salsa. Liz gets carne asada and I enfrijoladas. Rob is pretty wiped and heads to bed. The three of us wandered for a bit. Tony takes a photo of Liz and I kissing in kiss alley, though I think we do it in the wrong part.<br><br>At 3 we get a cab to the airport. We fly home and go straight into work.	21.014688, -101.254637	Sep 1, 2023	Sep 5, 2023	Rob & Tony																https://photos.app.goo.gl/J9YLbybpeWh6xrnp6
Fischer	Boyz 'n' Betty	305	x	I drive down to Austin after work and, in a few hours, arrive at the Philosopher's Playhouse where I drop off my stuff. I get a ride to Ego's where the boyz are busy getting started and singing some great karaoke including Fucked by a Redneck and Linkin Park. Over to King Bee for a casual chatting vibe and then to Outer Heaven for a Macho Man and tequila vibe. I ride back in Pabba's Tesla and we nearly rear end someone just after critiquing Elon Musk. Back at the playhouse, Matt bought 50 pounds of ice and makes an ice bath. He, Caleb and Anthony go all in. Ben and I dip our toes. More drinking and DJing. I sleep under the pool table.<br><br>We clean up and head to Batch for kolaches and coffee. Ben and Pat ride with me to Fischer. Ben asks to stop by an Amazon locker to pick up a box of Pussy, an energy drink he ordered just for the weekend. On the way down we decide it would be great to get a blow up sex doll for the river. Just as we mention it we see the unmistakable purple sign of an adult shop. We stop in, speak with a lovely attendant and get what we came for. Soon we've met the girls and are all on the river. Betty is a hit and we hit the tubes. We pop on some country, crack some beers and have an all-around good time. We quickly realize that the wind is cutting out nearly any progress the river is making. I eventually jump out and pull all thirty or so tubers downstream until we get to a point with a little more movement. From there it's mostly smooth sailing with the exception of a few bumpy rapids. We hang for a bit longer, somebody pops Bettys cherry and we head for Roughhouse. It's a great spot for nice drinks and good snacks. In a bit we say goodbye to the girls and head to the house. It's way out in the country. There are two cows in the field behind us. We settle in and pretty soon I start on food prep along with Michael, Pat, Caleb and Ben. It all takes a while, but in time we have a pretty good feast of fajita and fajita adjacent items. Caleb brings out Wavelength, a very good board game that we play for a bit. More time out back and then some POLISH, which a very fun and chaotic ping pong game, which I appear to be not very good at. More drinks and then bed. Someone is sleeping in the spot that I very clearly marked.<br><br>I wake and realize that Betty is the one in my spot. We all clean up a good bit and, before long, are out. I head up to Round Rock and spend a few hours with the Plunketts before heading home.	29.861063, -98.157655	Aug 25, 2023	Aug 27, 2023	Anthony, Michelle, Michael, Pat, Matt, Matt, Caleb, Pabba, Ben and many more.

New Orleans	Red Dress Run	304	x	On Thursday after work we make for the airport. We land. Our driver is a quirky lady who tells us about a group of local teenage girls who hijacked a teacher's car and decapitated her by driving off while her foot was caught in the seatbelt. Alexa and Joe meet us at the hotel and let us in. After a quick chat and giving him some homemade caramels Joe says goodnight. We help Alexa finish her tequila and then she and Liz head downstairs for a big drink and a couple of little drinks. I wrap up some work. The ladies come back. Liz considers a pizza, but instead opts for the pillow.<br><br>To the cafe for an orange creamsicle cold brew and a Pina Colada cold brew plus a boudin sausage roll. I work all day. Liz takes off around 1 and helps Alexa put some furniture together. After work we meet Joe at Meril, a sister (daughter) restaurant of Emeril. We dine on bone marrow drizzled oysters, candied ribs, cornbread, turkey necks, tuna tacos, BBQ shrimp, melon with prosciutto, cinnamon toast crunch bread pudding and chocolate creme brulee. It is a very delicious meal. Up to the bar for some more drinks and a chat with the charming Damien. Joe opts to hang there while the three of us head to La Madeleine, a charming library/hotel bar with spider web chandelier moulding, for a round of delicious drinks. Nite nite.<br><br>More cold brew and pastries. At 9:30 we don our red dresses and meet Joe and Alexa downstairs. Joe has on a big red wig that is Bette Midler meets Hey Arnold. His dress has plenty of bust space, which leaves room for his two tap tits. His left breast holds blueberry lemonade vodka and his right fireball whiskey. The nipples are taps, which he uses throughout the day to top up our drinks and also to nourish the occasional passer by. The four of us walk down to the French Quarter and head to the predetermined meeting spot, a bar. April is already there plus maybe a couple of other people. She is charming and we quickly hit it off. More and more people roll in, all sporting some shade of red and some type of dress or skirt. After a good starting round or two we walk. Walking is slow and adventurous. There are plenty of distractions and plenty of red dresses. I love this. It's so comfortably queer. I feel gorgeous and not at all worried or self conscious. I think our next stop is Oz. A bit of drinks, a bit of dancing, a bit of maybe flirting with a cute guy at the bar and a bit of getting yelled at by the doorwoman. Walking again. I'm still not used to being able to take drinks with me as I walk. The locals seem to plan it just right where they take enough to go that they finish it right as we get to the next oasis. It is hot out, but not as miserably hot as we had been prepared to expect. Between hopping from one shady spot to another and slowing for the AC rush pouring from tchotzky shops we manage to stave off any serious exhaustion. A zydeco band is grooving pretty hard in one spot. The man on washboard plays like he sleeps with that thing strapped to his chest. Another bar, another round. It's a fancy restaurant. I'm amazed they let us in, see-through dresses, bikini bulges and all. It's now one thirty and we're probably due to eat. Fortunately Joe has already planned for this and made us reservations at Tujagues, a famous restaurant in the quarter that apparently invented the standing bar, the Grasshopper, and brunch. The boudin balls make me appreciate the squishy, rice-ingrained sausage for the first time. Joe has a special device that shoots out confetti when giving high fives. By the end of the meal our table, drinks and turtle soup are all extra colorful. Alexa gives us a tour of the very historic building. The meal is a very good time. From there we all part ways. We are beat from the heat and drinks so we head back for a nap. In a few hours I attempt to meet April again, but we don't quite align. I check out the Craig Tracy art gallery, where he has just done a live human painting, and shops for a bit. Liz and Alexa come by. After a gander there Alexa takes us for yummy cocktails and killer Cuban at Manolito. Back towards the hotel we stop for Capt'n Crunch beer and Jager shots.<br><br>I think we leave quite early.	29.946494, -90.068159	Aug 10, 2023	Aug 13, 2023	Alexa, Joe, April																https://photos.app.goo.gl/MsKy18FGYq93khMu9
Chicago	Sweet Home Blue Meanies	303	x	We catch the Blue Line to Wicker Park. Foxtrot is offering Liz a discount on coffee and wine so we take them up on one of each. The Lou Malnati's here doesn't do dine in so we take a pie over to Wicker Park and chow in the grass. It is an ever-so-slightly warm day. People are playing with dogs. An ant crawls onto the pizza box. Workers power wash a house. A Jamaican man shouts. We walk down to Big Mini Putt Club, but aren't too impressed with the holes. We stick around for a bit to down a Par Killer and plan our next move...which is to Philz. I think I've had too much coffee today. Back on the Blue Line to Western and to the Concord Music Hall. We're there just at doors so we have a good bit of relaxing. Fortunately there are comfy benches. The opener is not good. The Tossers are pretty fun, though the consistent mic feedback and totally self-indulgent lighting tech take away from my joy. Then come the Meanies. They are quite fun. Billy, the lead singer is a real sweetheart and gem. Liz is a very happy lady right now. We catch a ride to the Sheraton by O'Hare and sleep for a few hours. Up early. They try to close the flight with three open seats on it, but Liz calls them out and they acquiesce. 	41.918592, -87.690168	Jul 22, 2023	Jul 23, 2023																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/arbGrNQZpV4s2asU9
Los Angeles	Cori-Sean, John-John, Russel-Ron	302	x	Our car is not here. We nearly settle on a Dodge Charger, but Liz thinks better of it and encourages them to find us a Kia, which they manage. We get killer flat burgers from Burgers Never Say Die. It's what the McDouble wishes it was. Next to the awesome and massive Hollywood Bowl. They Might be Giants takes the sun down with them in a cheery and groovy set. When the night is nigh, Sparks fly. The sound and lighting are fantastic. They sound great and are right at home. We drive straight back to the airport and get home at 6, with just enough time for a quick nap before starting work (and then both of us getting sick).	34.112268, -118.339514	Jul 16, 2023	Jul 16, 2023		Philadelphia, Quakertown, Los Angeles															https://photos.app.goo.gl/JLTjj49uvW5dPWps5
Quakertown	Cori-Sean, John-John, Russel-Ron	301	x	Our flight lands just before work time, so we work the first half of the day from the Admiral's Lounge. To get in, Liz tells them were going to Maine to explore Acadia National Park. After lunch we get a car and drive into Philly. Our first stop is a pizza restaurant. They tell us to get the cheesesteak. At the hotel we work and eat the sandwich, which is unequivocally the best one we've ever had. The bread feels artisanal and the beef/cheese/onion combo is umami ans creamy. Liz booked us a coursed dinner at Andiario in West Chester, so we hit the road. They start with fried peppers. Next is shaved cauliflower with fishy sauce. The rolled penne-ish pasta is heavenly. Next is a stunning crispy roasted hen. Last is honey and linden flower cake with honey ice cream, crumbles and honey drizzle. Gorgeous. All of it. We chat a good bit with Maria, a co-owner and FOH head, and also with Steve, who we realize we know from when we brunched at House Brasserie with Alexa, who he was dating at the time. After heading back to drop the car off, we walk to Bar where we meet Evelyn, Kelly, Kush and X. We drink White Claws, remember old times.<br><br>After working a half day we check out and head to Row Home for delicious pretzel breakfast sandwiches and cold brew. Onward to Quakertown, where we check into the Econolodge. It smells like old smoke. India and Parma greet us in the hall and let us know they're leaving because they found a bedbug. After thoroughly scanning our room and finding no sign of the critters we decide to stick it out. North to Kirkland Farm, where the rehearsal dinner is being held tonight. Many greetings. Sean & Cori are total babes and glowing. We dine on jerk chicken, cheesy mac, beer and pretty pies while connecting with Justin, Catherine and Nikhil. Justin shows us the baby pigeons he is overseeing. Speech time. Deb delights with a Mad Lib, Leigh presents a poem and Bryan gives us a (metaphorical) cube of sugar for our tea, not a bowl of custard. Sean shares his love of computer science by having us take part in a merge sort, arranged by date met them. Inside, at the pie zone, Jonna and Nancy speak of spluging cherries. More chats with Alex, Leigh, India and Parma. Water from Wawa.<br><br>Dunkin and then I go back to the farm for a morning yoga class around the pool. Deb loans me a mat. A doggo joins in. Back to the hotel. Soon we head to the Quakertown Farmer's Market, which ends up not being nearly as charming as it sounds. It's a big bazaar full of mostly junk. There is a Trump simp store. I'm presenting moderately femme and am at least starting to be more okay getting looks, even in a place like this. We share some okay pizza. After a clean up we join many other on the shuttle to the farm. The chairs are arranged in a circle in a quaint glade. The bride and groom are seated amongst us. Folks are looking fab. A man, who is not an officiant, informs us that this will be a Quaker-influenced experience and that we will sit in silence for about twenty minutes with the caveat that, if someone feels compelled to share a brief thought, they may. We begin. The first five or so minutes is a peaceful and warm settling in. One person shares an appreciation of love. Another their awareness of the cosmos. Another that a spider is crawling on her leg. A couple more about love. Once that wraps up, Sean and Cori step into the center of the circle. They share what most might call vows, though they are more gracious thoughts on their partner. They then take turns sharing "five good things" about the other person. And then, refreshingly unceremoniously, it's done. The group moves up the hill for cocktails, cheese, veggies, figs, chatting and sun. One of the cocktails is named "The Marquis" and the other "The Loiselle". Liz finishes writing her speech. India and Parma connect. Selfies in the sunset. The cheese is sweating. After salad comes a delish dinner of lasagna, penne in pink sauce and chicken. India shares memories of POD and Toes in the Fan. Peter his journey from "teacher" to "friend" to both C&S. I Three Good Things I've learned from Sean. Liz musings on justice. Hugs and soon their Sean and Cori-ographed dance to Still the One featuring a flash mob ending. Dandelion chocolate. Levaine cookies. The sun dips below the clouds and soon were led through the barn attic, which is a yoga/dance studio/reception hall. There are pretzels, pizza, and bottles of alcohol. We rest for a few. In time the music gets louder and the lights dimmer. Lots of dancing. Very silly dancing. I believe in a fin cold luff and I like big butts. Jonna feeds us pretzel and beer. Loz lets me use her flats. Toes in the pool and soon the shuttle back.<br><br>We rise and head back to the farm. C&S have coffee and bagels ready for us. We sit with Barbara and Doug. We break down classical structures and talk Kids these Days. Back to Philly. Lunch is beautiful bagles Korshak's. Long hot pepper BLT with scallion schmear. Lox on everything. We eat on the plane to LA.	40.539678, -75.305681	Jul 13, 2023	Jul 16, 2023	Evelyn, Cori & Sean, wedding guests 	Philadelphia, Quakertown, Los Angeles															https://photos.app.goo.gl/JLTjj49uvW5dPWps5
Worcester	Mass NY	300	x	On Saturday we try for three flights before calling it quits for the rest of the day.<br><br>We try for a late afternoon flight on Sunday and make it. We land late, get a car, drive west and arrive at Kelly and a Chris' place in the wee hours of the morning. We chat for a bit and watch some How to with John Wilson. Then we go to bed.<br><br>I wake up at 11:30 and make coffee. I sit near Yaga, but she's not into it so I hang in the kitchen and read. We stop by Wendy's and head to Framingham Public Library. Kelly demos a very cool laser cutter and gives me a Framingham Pride Bookmark she made with the 3D printer. I find Santi's book. We pick blueberries out front. Back at the house we hang and soon prep dinner. We start with blueberry G&Ts and caramelized onion dip. For mains we do roasted broccoli & cabbage and salmon en papillote. Dessert is blueberries and ricotta in crescent rolls.<br><br>A late morning. After 3 we drive west and a while later meet Paige, Eric, Jack and Noah at their home somewhere near a dairy farm and an abandoned golf course in western MA. Jack asks me if I'm a boy or a girl. I go with "girly boy". They give us a tour, we play soccer out back and spend a good while having a nice chat. We head to downtown Northampton and get good stuff at Local Burger. Today is July 4th. We regularly hear small-scale fireworks going off. After dinner we walk through the dark and drizzly streets. Jack encourages us to come back to theirs for ice cream, to which we oblige. At 11:30 we hit the road back to Kelly and Chris'.<br><br>Helen comes by and Kelly drives us to Gloucester, which apparently has one of the nicest beaches in MA. I have no other reference point, but this is indeed a lovely beach in a cove with soft sand and calm, warmish water. Quite a lot of other people had the same idea as us it seems. We spend a few hours alternating between the water and the towels. Kelly finds a dead crab. Helen likes trying to hear what nearby groups are talking about. The granita dealer appears to be lonely and expresses gratitude that I don't understand sign language. Kelly drives us through Salem and then we get junk food from a 7/11 before heading back home. Liz and I have a go at finding a Hinge match for Helen. Chris makes us an incredible, rhythmically flattened chicken parmesean and eggplant parmesan. We watch a few episodes of The Rehearsal and snooze.<br><br>Up earlyish and to Miss Worcester Diner for spam & eggs plus a Philly cheese steak omelette. The English muffin is griddled with browned butter and is something special. We head south and west, through Connecticut and into the Hudson River Valley. We arrive at Storm King, a 500 acre sculpture park in the woody mountains. We start by taking the tram on a ride around the whole of the park, getting to take in many of the metal, stone and fiberglass works from afar. We get off at the fourth stop, admire a three-legged Buddha, and wander on. Before long a thunderstorm rolls in and we run to the main hall just in time for a shelter-in-place lockdown. Fortunately it doesn't last too long and we're back out again. We march further on, but the heat is now brutal so we bend our way back towards the parking lot. We cool down and drive north to the hotel for a relax. In a while it feels like dinner time. We pick a promising pizza place in Poughkeepsie. The Cesar salad is the first sign we chose well. The dressing is house-made and plentiful with a confident declaration of anchovy. The tomatoes are soft and slightly funky, maybe semi-sun dried. Then the pizza comes. It's Detroit style: rectangular deep dish with cheese right on the dough and spread to the edges. The crust is buttery, crunchy, chewy and soft in all the right ways. The toppings pack a punch and balance beautifully. Good job place. Good job. We discussed the possibility of seeing Asteroid City, but opt to check out the bar next door, Goodnight Kenny, instead. I get a Naked and Famous and Liz a frozen rummy yummy babe. We end with a delish espressoey jello shot. There was talk of still watching a movie at the hotel, but sleep (and Zelda) win.<br><br>Early up. We first go to Dia Beacon for gorgeous spaces and ultra-minimalist art. Most of it doesn't do a whole lot for me, but the Louise Bourgeois attic is pretty stellar. We hit the road north and in a while we're at Mass MOCA. Thanks to Liz's very best planning we have four different special timed exhibits booked that we begin as soon as we arrive. The first two are VR pieces by Laurie Anderson and are pretty interesting. The next two are James Turrell works. The first of which is Akhob-like with strobe lights and the second reminiscent of the Naoshima church. Both are fantastic. We take in some more Turrell plus an EJ Hill rollercoaster, Bourgeois marble pieces, Kiefer concrete and Franz West appendages. We step outside for cheesesteak, beers, falafel and a singer/songwriter. After a good bit of that we head out back for a sunset experience in the Turrell Skyspace, which is made from a converted water tower. We spend about 30 minutes watching the sky turn dark as the room cycles through an array of complementary and contrasting colors. Each color gives the sky hole a different quality. Some awe. We drive back, hang with Kelly and Chris and watch The Mighty Boosh.<br><br>Liz and I join Kelly and Yaga for a morning walk. Kelly teaches us about many of the local flowers. Soon we drive to Evergreen Room in Hudson for yummy drinks and a beautiful charcuterie board. Halaena texts us to let us know that we are grandparents. Liz and I head on to meet Bryan, Michelle, Gigi, Cici, James, Petals and Natalie at their lovely home. We spend hours catching up, playing outside, talking horror movies and snacking on pizza. Back at Kelly and Chris' we hang, watch Snuff Box and share our gratitude.<br><br>We wake at 4 and do all the stuff to get home to see the new additions to our family.	42.701534, -73.116940	Jul 1, 2023	Jul 9, 2023	Worcester, Northampton, Gloucester, Salem, Hudson River Valley, Poughkeepsie, North Adams, Sudbury			42.257842, -71.779162	42.701534, -73.116940	41.499695, -73.981570	41.424424, -74.058311	42.257842, -71.779162	42.319870, -72.628676	42.257842, -71.779162	42.382529, -71.415390	42.257842, -71.779162	42.652432, -70.688884				https://photos.app.goo.gl/vys7wYCQoftAcHzr9
El Paso	Unexpected Tiki	299	x	We check into our hotel and meet the boys downstairs. They're staying just next door. We walk past the Chihuahuas' baseball game and to The Tiki Room. Both the food and drink menus look promising so we get mochiko chicken, bbq ribs and spam masubi for snack. For drink we do Ube Chi Chi, The Floor is Guava, Tradewinds, Mai Tai, Zombie and an El Presidente. Everything is wonderful. We chat with the lovely owners for a few and buy a neat Mai Tai glass. Onto Deadbeach Brewery for some good beers and smoked chicken. We make for the gayborhood where we check out a couple of bars.<br><br>Liz and I don't leave the hotel until 11:30. The boys pick us up and take us to Martha's, a Dallas Cowboys-adorned spot. We do tacos and chilaquiles, which definitely help Liz and I to feel more alive again. Liz found a farmer's market only a few minutes away, so we pop over there and grab coffe and a vegan lemon cake. We have a couple of hours to kill before they need to return the car so we go for a drive up the mountains and take in a couple of nice overlooks of the city. Back down into town we stroll through a municipal rose garden that happens to be in peak bloom. The leek flowers are blowing their tops. To the airport for a bit of downtime until our flight.	31.756966, -106.493678	Apr 28, 2023	Apr 29, 2023	Rob & Tony																https://photos.app.goo.gl/oraMk4UK5oxiWuce6
New Orleans	Gay Easter	298	x	We head straight for The Saint Hotel. Our room is not the Lucifer, but Heavenly and nice. We meet Alexa at Cochon Butcher for cocktails, catch up and meat. We see her off to work and hit the road again. We chit chat with the Jo Malone woman at the mall, try on masks and stop in Fritzel's for a round of hurricanes in a charming alley that smells of cat. Maybe coincidentally, there is a house ginger cat. Liz says hi. He is aloof. We stroll Bourbon St for a bit and decide to pop into a bar for hand grenades and a terrace with a view. A server throws an old lemon wedge down into the street and hits a woman with it. We pop back to the hotel for a bit to relax, clean up and eat macarons before heading to Emeril's. It is, fortunately, a pretty quiet evening there and we're able to sit at the bar and chat with Alexa for a few hours. She starts us off with cute Ramos gin fizzes, which she tops with confetti. She makes us a few rounds of very delicious drinks and we get increasingly silly. She also keeps getting delicious food sent to the table like foie, tartare, ragu, Cajun shrimp and a s'mores cake. A nice man in a bunny suit gets our entire tab. Once Alexa is off for the night we stop by a dive bar nearby for a final round. I maybe fall asleep at the bar.<br><br>I start the day feeling pretty not great. We get ready and catch a ride to Seafood Sally's, an adorable colonial cottage serving killer Viet Cajun delights. We do oysters with nouc cham, fried turkey necks with possibly more nouc cham, a big fabulous boil of crawfish, crab and shrimp that has a killer very Vietnamese sauce and some beautiful honey drizzled cornbread. I'm feeling much better now. Back at the hotel we get dolled up in our gayest garb and make for the Gay Easter Parade in the French quarter. Well, first we grab a couple more rounds of drinks and then catch the festivities. It is so joyous and queer. There are a lot of families out, which is very heartening to see. The parade feels like a mix of Mardi Gras, Easter and Pride. We get tossed beads, bunny ears and a baby toy snake. We do a final round of drinks, give hugs and make for the sky.	29.949179, -90.132758	Apr 8, 2023	Apr 9, 2023	David, Alexa																https://photos.app.goo.gl/pMKNah1QMt96uY3x5
Cleburne State Park	Plunkett Camp pt 2	297	x	I arrive at around 5. Justin and Nixon have been there for a while and have already set up camp. We check check out the waterfront, take a short trail stroll and get in a bit of frisbee. Back at camp Justin grills up some delicious chicken fajitas, which Danielle made for us. After cleaning up, we build a fire, sing traditional American songs (Party in the USA) and make s'mores.<br><br>I get up first and prep coffee. After my morning meditation I cook up bacon, hash browns and scrambled eggs. We take it pretty easy for a while with some hammock reading and a good bit of frisbee. I make us sandwiches for lunch and then we head out to Dinosaur Valley State Park, just past the Creation Evidence Museum. There are some very cool looking ____ tracks. Just next to them are some large holes, which we later learn are where people have cut out fossils and taken them. After the main tracks we see the Ballroom Tracks, which are under a bit of water and have a lot of kids running on them. Back to camp for more hammock time. When the sun starts getting low, Justin throws some charcoal in the pit and gets a fire going. We put the beans in the cast iron skillet and the dogs on the grate. It starts to drizzle so we set up the canapy over the pit. Dinner is yummy. We take in the fire and make another batch of s'mores. It's a bit chillier tonight, so we tuck in not too long after.<br><br>It rained a good bit throughout the night and is still going. It's also quitre cold now. The camp is a muddy mess, but we get things cleaned up as well as we can and get out. We drive into the town of Cleburne and find a quintessential small town breakfast spot for pancakes, eggs, bacon, hash browns, biscuits & gravy and endless coffee. With warmer hands and fuller bellies we say our goodbyes and head home.	32.263262, -97.555527	Apr 21, 2023	Apr 23, 2023	Justin, Nixon																https://photos.app.goo.gl/2XWECApMit62wy7q6
San Diego	Tulossan	296	x	We get a car, drop our bags off at the hotel and make for Pacific Beach. Our first stop is Oscars for four kinds of fish taco. The weather is sunny and just warm enough to enjoy a casual stroll down the beachfront until we are ready to plop our bums in the sand and take a good long look at the ocean. After 180 waves we decide we've seen enough. Up to a cove crowded with seals, sea lions, pelicans, pretty black-and-blue birds and tourists. Some of the tourists come too close to a big lion sleeping on the sand and get a firm-but-gentle reminder from the faceless lifegod in a tinted hut. Through the hills is a delicious little ice cream shop serving us a scoop of mango and sticky rice and a scoop of strawberry cheesecake on a beautiful, slightly cinnamony, waffle cone. Mothership is a bustling post tiki post apocalyptic space outpost. We squeeze into a standing spot at the bar and drain two drinks. Part Time Lover fronts and backs as a record store, but middles as a gorgeous cocktail bar. We clean two more glasses and I buy 180 grams of Hounds of Love. We sneak a cheeky Del Taco and retreat to the room for a crash. Wake, wash and ride to Juniper & Ivy for some pan-world fare of sourdough, hummus, salad, raviolo and gnocchi. It is fine until Liz finds mashed potatoes in the raviolo. That is not fine. We don't stick around to try any mashed potatoe cheesecake bullshit. Wolfie's Carousel bar is cute, but packed and not a place we need to wait around for. It turns out to be the same story for False Idol. Nothing else is giving us a tickle and we're both peckish for a pillow so we do that.<br><br>I get some cheap donuts and okay coffee to bring back to a sleepy lady. After checking out we make for Raised by Wolves, which we discover doesn't open for another three-and-a-half hours. Fortunately it's right next to Le Labo and Din Tai Fung so we stock up on perfume and dumplings. There's still a bit of time to kill so we make for Torrey Pines. The cliffs and waves are pretty. When we look up we see paragliders, down maybe naked beach dwellers and out dolphins playing in the swells. Through the rotating fireplace and we're in the fantastical wolf den for four fab fabulous fabrications. After our time with Taylor we check in and self care. We drop the car off at the airport, walk for a while to get out of the high price zone and then catch a ride to False Idol. Three cheeky rounds, swizzle stick earrings, so many glass globes. Late night Shake Shack is a very correct way to end things.<br><br>We work all day and then catch a flight home.	32.889834, -117.251163	Mar 25, 2023	Mar 27, 2023		Tucson, Los Angeles, San Diego		32.284011, -111.197993	34.078000, -118.474106	32.889834, -117.251163											https://photos.app.goo.gl/aDxwb24GjfxfKd7E7
Los Angeles	Tulossan	295	x	Courage is closed today, so we head to Cos for a bit of shopping and then to Bay Cities to pick up a burrata caprise sandwich and a many Italian meats sandwich. While we're waiting to order Eric Wareheim walks in. We do a quick hello and praise. Munch in the car. Onto Giant Robot Store for a look around and then to Petit Trois for a Paris Brest. We check into the Westin and relax for just a bit before making a two-hour drive down to Irvine. Yeo Kwang, Ji Young, Elizabeth and Song. Have us over for a lovely dinner at their place. When we walk in, the girls hand us adorable pictures they drew. We dine on a large variety of delicious traditional dishes and spend a few hours catching up.<br><br>Liz has an interview this morning, so I grab a cheeky bite and coffee downstairs. Before long we head to Courage for classic good stuff plus one with cave-aged cheddar and yellow tomato. Next we head to The Getty. We park at the base of a mountain and take a tram up to the museum. We spend the next few hours exploring very good older European art. Some highlights are the Monet, Van Gogh and Ensor works. Back to the hotel for a nap and then back out to Petit Trois for soup a l'ongion, escargot, a Big Mec and a filet au poivre. All are incredible and paired with lovely reds. We drive a few minutes more to arrive at Hatch for our Nest reservation. Nest is part escape room, part immersive theatre. We spend about an hour rummaging through a dead woman's storage unit and uncovering the tragic story of her life. It is beautifully done and evokes a flurry of emotions in me. Our last stop for the night is Walt's for some beer, pinball and a very fun sort of inverted pachinko game.<br><br>A casual morning and hearty hotel breakfast to start. After some relaxing we make for Langer's Deli for the most ridiculous pastrami sandwich I can conceive of. Dessert is a tall fluffy slice of strawberry cheesecake. We hoped to squeeze an architectural tour of Granada Hills in today, but the traffic won't allow it so we relax for a bit longer at the hotel. In a bit we make for Chromasonic, a Akhob-esque color and sound installation that Raphael's brother created. Unlike Alhob, Chromasonic has you lie in comfy reclined position, which is pretty nice. The journey is wonderful and feela great to take in. Another quick hotel stop before we make for Clifton's Republic, a three-story, proto (or maybe post) tiki cavern of curiosities. Both drinks are orange colored and delicious. To Night + Market Song for fried chicken, short rib panang curry and tofu pad see ewe. The curry is especially concentrated and fresh in it's flavor. Ten or so minutes north and we're at Verdugo Bar. Santi is DJing out back. I grab a drink and we see Megan. She is a beam of light for the entire evening. It's such an easy joyful experience reconnecting with her. We spend a good few hours talking about ideas, desires, hurts, and growths. Then we take adorable photo booth strips.<br><br>Early flight to San Diego.	34.078000, -118.474106	Mar 22, 2023	Mar 25, 2023	Megan Irwin, The Yun Family	Tucson, Los Angeles, San Diego		32.284011, -111.197993	34.078000, -118.474106	32.889834, -117.251163											https://photos.app.goo.gl/aDxwb24GjfxfKd7E7
Tucson	Tulossan	294	x	This was meant to be a trip to Easter Island, but after that didn't work we hung at home for the weekend l, deliberating on what our constellation trip would be. We eventually land on Tucson, LA and San Diego. After some delay and a change of flight we arrive in Tucson. We get a car and drive straight to Tacos Apson for a yummy tripa, coatillas and alambre with a big horchata. Chef's kiss. To the hotel where I need a nap after that meal. We then head for Saguaro National Park. There had been a good rain recently and the flora is l, as Heather guessed, verdant. We spend hours looking at the pretty plants, the pretty mountains and the pretty clouds while we hike a pretty nice trail. On the way back we grab a Pina colada eegee and a ranch fry with not enough ranch. After a nap, shower and painful epilation test we head to Tito & Pep for a lovely dinner if charred beets & broccoli, hamachi & sea bass crudo, salad with garlicy steak and a passion fruit buttermilk panna cotta. To Kon Tiki for some cheap drinks and then to bed.<br><br>Exo for a mole latte and an orange cardamom latte with a beautiful chocolate croissant. Anita is closed due to maintenance so we head to Tumerico for a yummy vegan barbacoa breakfast. We drop off some postcards, get a gallon of water and head east. In two hours we're at Chiricahua National Monument, a mountain range filled with thousands of ancient stone pillars. A kind conservationist recommends the Echo Canyon loop. We drive up and start our hike. It's very windy at the top, but once we decend into the pillars it's not so bad. They are stunning, surreal and seemingly impossible. The grotto is a particular treat. After spending a couple of hours circling the loop we head on back to Tucson and straight to Anello for killer focaccia with marmalade and ricotta, a green garlic pizza with local sausage, and a bianca pizza. All are killer. The dough is super thi and firm under the toppings and pillowy with a light crunch at the crust. Kiss kiss. A minute or so south and we're at Owl's Club, which is a bar palimpsest in a funeral home. The Gila River is, in Liz's words, one of the best bourbon cocktails she's ever had.<br><br>Up early for a flight to LA.	32.284011, -111.197993	Mar 20, 2023	Mar 22, 2023		Tucson, Los Angeles, San Diego		32.284011, -111.197993	34.078000, -118.474106	32.889834, -117.251163											https://photos.app.goo.gl/aDxwb24GjfxfKd7E7
Coachella Valley 	Week and strong	293	x	I walk up a big black wooden half circle at the base of the mountains. We meander through a maze of yellow chain link fence. Mike has us over for a fabulous dinner of steak, corn and kringle. I make mom and Mike salmon pesto pasta. I buy a cute vintage belt buckle and funky grey shirt from the Palm Springs vintage market. I organize mom's paint collection and touch up her walls. We do a varying-in-size-and-strength margarita happy hour and then crash karaoke at the lodge. I get her passwords secure and check for carbon monoxide.	33.707876, -116.401687	Feb 25, 2023	Mar 5, 2023	Mom, Mike, lodge folk 																https://photos.app.goo.gl/bA6cNW5w63fcFrXcA
Louisville	Dita Dita	292	x	Our first stop is Fleur de Flea, a large and awesome antique mall. Out front, a man is using a large magnifying glass to burn artwork into wooden planks. We don't get anything, though our needs are pretty darn specific these days, like a brass apple with butt cheeks. We walk for a few to Logan Street Market for a killer pastramied salmon and egg bagel plus a kouing amann. To the hotel where we nap for a couple of hours. Nothing sounds particularly enticing here food wise, but we're right next to a White Castle, which neither of us has been to, so we check it out. It isn't very good. Back to the hotel to get dolled up. We walk down to 4th Street with a plan to grab a drink, though the bars there seem pretty corporate looking. We head instead to Meta, a pretty hip cocktail bar, just south of the main drag. We each get a pretty good cocktail and then a shot. Just across the street is The Palace Theater, which is absolutely stunning. Liz describes it as a Venetian dream. The ceiling is particularly memorable, which is patterned with famous folks heads poking down towards us. The show is fabulous. Though our seats aren't nearly as good as those in Dallas, it's an absolute joy. As before, taking in the audience's attire is an event of it's own. We walk back to 4th for a slice of pizza and a beerr. Just as we're heading out, Johnny McGovern walks in and sits down next to us. We chat for a few and head back to bed. Up at 4:30 to catch the first flight of the day.	38.248045, -85.757916	Feb 18, 2023	Feb 19, 2023																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/zYzUdUaxYXCtBZRz5
Yucutan	Driving	291	x	We get a car from the airport and drive on a wide smooth road cut straight through lush jungle for two hours. We pass through two small towns. One is having a carnival today. The other has the circus in town. We park at Chiquila and get a ferry to Holbox. We walk through the wet, sandy streets and check into a very pretty hotel. I take a 15 minute nap, and then we walk into town. We get a mushroom quesadilla and a few tacos. They are on thick blue corn tortillas and served with beautiful salsas. The chef brings us some locally made mezcalito, which is quite good. We walk to the beach just in time for a colorful sunset. We play in the water and watch the sky slowly fade. After a stroll up and down the beach we make for a restaurant for nice mezcal cocktails featuring green tomatoes plus guacamole with crickets and some great tacos. It's not even 9, but we're both wiped and head to bed.<br><br>I relax and read by the pool for a good bit. When I come back we touch in the shower. Into town first for a juicy Mexican coffee from José at Alta Nota. A few gems from José: "Now smell it. It's paradise",  "It's like a poem of cacao, peach... red fruits". We buy beans and treats to go then wet our feet on the beach for a bit, buy a pretty ceramic cup, and stop for a bean sauce pizza topped with cochinita pibil. We get and expensive ATV ride to the port, catch the ferry back, and drive for three hours to Valladolid. Liz gets us a room in a nice hotel smack dab in the middle of the city. After a quick rest we head through the park and to a food cart that sells cochinita pibil tacos plus a torta of similar taste. From there we wander the streets for a good bit. We pass through a very posh part of town. Liz gets a little cat head ornament and I get a nice cardigan. Back to the square for a leche churro and then back for Tecate and El Camino.<br><br>Breakfast is nice coffee drinks with enfrijoladas and . From there we get the car and drive north for about half an hour to Ek Balam. It's a large and stunning ancient Mayan city which was, for a time, the seat of the Mayan kingdom. Part of the original plaster is preserved and it's magnificent. It's the entrance to a kings tomb and has visitors walk though the teeth lined jaws of a giant mythical beast. We drive a few minutes further onto Cenote Xcanche. We decent about four flights of stairs, following the lines of repelling tree roots down to the deep aqua pool. I have no concept of just how deep it is. There are just a few other people in the hole with us and we all find moments of silence broken only by the occasional drip. Back on the surface we dry off in awkward hammocks until they tell us it's time to leave. Liz's headache has picked up considerably and she spends the rest of the evening in bed. I explore more of the city center and feast on some delicious burritos and horchata. After picking up water and churros I kick back in the hotel, half watch I Don't Feel at Home in this World Anymore and work on crossstitch designs.<br><br>After taking our time and me doing a bit of work we check out and drive to Chichén-Itzá. About 10 miles away we get stopped by a group of semi-official looking folks in vests who tell us we need a free special sticker to park close in and also that we should spend and extra $30 on tickets to buy from them. We take the sticker, but decline the pricey ticket. When we arrive at the site they tell us that sticker has no meaning. We park right next to the entrance. There are A LOT of vendors here. I soon get tired of smiling and nodding at folks. The ruins are amazing. The temple of K'uk'ulkan is mesmerizing and the ball court is majestic. Though it's warm out, there's a fair amount of shade and that allows to to take our time strolling through the surreal space. When the clouds are covering the sun, we lie down in the grass and take in the space. I'm reminded of sitting under the Eiffel tower with Liz ten years ago. We get back on the road and, in three hours, are in Playa del Carmen. We check in and soon meet Rob & Tony. They take us across the plaza to Ay Taco for some damn good tacos, plus an el pastor quesadilla for good measure. We spend a good while strolling the seemingly endless strip before heading back to the hotel for drinks in the garden.<br><br>Across the plaza for coffee. At noon, we change hotels and I scrape the side of the car in the parking garage. From there we do a mini road trip to Puerto Morelos. We soon find a nice seafood restaurant on the beach where Cici serves us ceviche and an excellent grilled fish that a man just brought in. We stroll the beach and town for a bit until we get hot and head back to the hotel. After a nap I head to a yoga class across the plaza. We meet back up with the boys, grab some okay brats from a street stall, and then head back to the hotel pool for some wine and beer.<br><br>It's a late morning filled with laziness and work duties. We eventually get out for a late lunch at Mariscos y Clamatos El Doctorcito for pretty good ceviche and drinks. We make it down to the beach in time to catch another beautiful sunset. I stop by a shop and get some nice undies and then we head back to the hotel and start watching inside man. Two hours in we break to pick up a pizza and take it back to the room for the next two episodes. Out to a bar for a nightcap and then to bed.<br><br>I bring in coffe and very yummy pastries. Soon we meet up with R&T and drive south. Our first stop is the Tulum ruins, which are not as impressive looking as the other sites we've visited on this trip, but are stunning as they're set right up against some seaside cliffs. We head into Tulum and, after much deliberation, settle on a quite good ceviche place that serves a delicious michelada. We're all pretty sticky and tired so, after two more unsuccessful stops, we head back to the hotel and nap. When it's nice and dark we meet the boys up on the rooftop for wine and snacks late into the night.<br><br>We, for the first time in this trip, wake up early enough to get the hotel breakfast. I order "divorced eggs", which are fried eggs topped with two different types of sauce. We get cleaned up, check out and attempt to buff out the scratches, without much success. We head to a restaurant a few doors down to see a drag brunch. They're running about 90 minutes behind, but after much anticipation we catch three ladies lip sync to a bunch of songs we don't know and a few we do. We then head out and hit the road back to Cancun. I do my best to cover the scratches with a bit of mud and somehow it works. As the flight attendant is doing the safety demonstration an automated voice from the seat behind me loudly states "Charge your phone you dumb stupid bitch". Everyone has a good chuckle. David picks us up, shows us some of the work being done to his ceiling and takes us to Fuel City.	20.890824, -88.137559	Dec 3, 2022	Dec 11, 2022	Rob & Tony	Holbox, Valladolid, Ek Balam, Cichen-Itza, Play del Carmen, Puerto Morelos, Tulum															https://photos.app.goo.gl/zpq93pgnwKUByKzZA
Cornwall	Southern England	290	x	We spend the night in Exeter, eat a hoisin duck wrap plus a curry chicken sandwich, watch The Lure and drink canned cocktails. Just before we would head to bed Liz discovers Better Call Saul season 6 is on Netflix here. There are 13 episodes! We watch one and head to bed.<br><br>A pretty decent full English breakfast from the Holiday Inn Express and and we head into Dartmoor National Park. Our first stop is a misty mountain dotted with grazing ponies. The beauty of the ponies, the mountain and the rolling landscape behind is surreal. Next we park by Two Bridges Hotel and hike along a river valley for about two miles to Wistman's Wood, a centuries-old moss-covered oak forest that feels like it would fit right into Middle Earth. Liz falls on the slippery slopey trail three times and wets her bottom. We climb the hill to see the rocky tors and happy cows. We make our way back and stop into the hotel pub for a pasty, chips, a cask ale and a cream tea, all of which are excellent. A few minutes drive west followed by a mile walk through rain and sheep and we're at Foggintor Quarry. It's deep and steep and contained and beautiful. We get cozy and each find a nice spot to take it all in for a while. After some nice pics and a rainy walk back we hit the road to Penzance. Two or so hours later we're here. We pop into Saintsbury's to stock up on more wine and chocolate. Our hotel is a charming inn right in the heart of the town. After putting our stuff down we head on a bit further to Mackerel Sky Seafood Bar for wine, scallops, mussels in cream with tarragon, smoked mackerel mac & cheese, crab nachos, samphire, potatoes and pumpkin kimchi. Back to the hotel for wine, snacks and BCS.We sleep in, drink instant coffee and hot chocolate, and then check out. We wander the high street. I buy I Will Survive on 45 from an antique shop. We get books and cards from another. I read an entire, very short, book with a delicious oat flat white at a cafe with the bathroom tap on the ceiling. A few minutes on I become entranced by a heavily-reverberated flood of plucked strings. I follow the sound to find a heavily-bearded person flat picking Irish melodies on a four-string banjo. We make our way to the stunning, sunny, surreal promenade. Two divers prepare to go under. A swimmer traverses the bay. The art deco lido anchors the waterfront. Liz finds a pub, which is a British Naval ship version of The Golden Tiki. We split whitebait plus a Proper Fish & Chips. When we arrive at St. Michael's Mount we discover the tide is high and the boats stop running in November so we only admire it from afar. There's still a good two hours of daylight so we make for St. Ives on the north coast. Cute wooden postcards. Pushing pennies. Cornish ice cream on the harbor. Dusty greens and purples fade into evening. We walk to the hill at the end of the cape and take in the lights of the town against the blackening sky. Fireworks sparkle on the horizon. We hold each other in the chilly evening air. An hour or so Londonward and we're at Jamaica Inn for steak and ale pie, onion rings and cask ale. We had originally planned on staying here tonight, but they're fully booked. I don't mind though because this place feels pretty touristy and it's the worst food we've eaten in this trip. Liz instead books us a room at The Bodmin Jail Hotel. Built in the 1790's, it now is the site of a stunning and luxurious hotel. Our room takes up three former cells. The middle cell once held William Lightfoot, a murderer who was eventually hanged at the jail. We stay up late watching more Saul.<br><br>After a great Full English we partake in the Bodmin Jail Museum/Experience, which is a cross between a museum and a Disneyland ride entrance. Much like the hotel it is exceptionally well produced, featuring a real time shipwreck, a big scary cat, and an immersive execution. We drive north to Tintagel Castle, which has been more of a ruins than a castle for something like the last 800 years. It's the site of the maybe fictional King Arthur and Merlin. It's rainy and windy and very beautiful. Onto Boscastle only to discover that the witch museum closed for the season a few days ago. A few more minutes up the road is a bustling cafe which serves a solid cream tea. We drive east for four hours, grab a curry from Raj of India and check into a hotel by Heathrow. We eat on the bed and watch more Better Call Saul. Raj is so good. The korma is nutty and creamy while the masala has a notes of coconut and smoke.<br><br>A bit of cold curry and instant coffee before we head to the airport.	50.117086, -5.534246	Nov 2, 2022	Nov 6, 2022		London, Suffolk, Cornwall		51.523613, -0.134659	52.401557, 1.412880	50.556063, -3.964624	50.117086, -5.534246	50.218150, -5.476553	50.474721, -4.728444	50.666818, -4.758471	50.694260, -4.678438						https://photos.app.goo.gl/fPhz5fct8ykq9jMXA
Suffolk	Southern England	289	x	In 90 minutes we're in Whitham, Liz's hometown. We visit her childhood home, pass the chicken shop and buy lots of chocolate from her old Tesco. In another 90 minutes we're at Willow Barn in very rural Suffolk. We have a little time in the light and Alix gives us a quick tour of her stunning home. From there we drink tea and chat a good while. She serves a homegrown celeriac soup with two salads and an apple cake. We talk deep into the evening.<br><br>I get up with the sun and take pictures of droopy flowers. After coffee and croissants Alix gives us a thorough tour of the grounds, flowers, moat, greenhouse, willow and vole holes. I am inspired to do more with the garden and know Liz is too. From there we clean up and head into Halesworth where we walk through the town, she teaches us about flint walls and takes us for lunch. We have sausage rolls and desserts. Next we hit the road and drive west for eight hours.	52.401557, 1.412880	Nov 1, 2022	Nov 2, 2022	Alix	London, Suffolk, Cornwall		51.523613, -0.134659	52.401557, 1.412880	50.556063, -3.964624	50.117086, -5.534246	50.218150, -5.476553	50.474721, -4.728444	50.666818, -4.758471	50.694260, -4.678438						https://photos.app.goo.gl/fPhz5fct8ykq9jMXA
London	Southern England	288	x	We get business. I eat a steak and sleep. Once down we take the Picadilly line downtown, check in, clean up and head back out. Liz spots a vintage photo booth, so we do that and then head to the Grant Museum of Zoology, which is full of sliced skulls, frog holes and jars of moles. We walk onto Soho, which is more jam packet than I remember, and onto Palomar. Orange wine, schnitzel, kubaneh, labneh, ikura, hummus, beef tartare, enoki, chicken parts and a fried sea bream. We check out the shops on Regent St, but neither of us are feeling inspired. We're too tired to even go out to a cocktail bar so we head back to the hotel and sleep until 11:30 a.m.<br><br>I grab some coffee from nearby. Soon we head out to meet Irene and Juan for lunch at Rosa's Thai, which is quite good, especially Juan's fried aubergine. After a nice time chatting they walk is to King's Cross where we catch a train to Stevenige to meet Jessica and Nelson. We catch up for a few, greet Nelson with many treats and dine on the fantastic Sunday roast Jessica has prepared. She serves honey-glazed carrots, skin on mashed potatoes, broccoli and lamb shoulder stewed in garlic. It is killer good. We spend a good while catching up, drinking after eights and coaxing Nelson to get closer to us. Soon Roy, her dad, comes by with his two cats Monty and Floyd and we share chocolate cheesecake. They share their love of Cornwall. Time flys by and we catch a train back to the hotel. Katsu curry crisps and bed.<br><br>We sleep in again. We find out from Rob that he's still not feeling well and will cancel their trip. We're feeling so good about being here that we decide to extend our time in England and do a road trip out to the southwest tip of Britain. I pick up more coffee and at around 1 we head out. We Central line to Bond street and to The Mayfair Chippy for beautiful oysters and unquestionably the best fish and chips either of us has ever had. Absolute perfection. From there we hop across the street to Selfridges and pick up treats for friends and family. We head east and pop into a record shop for a look. Liz heads to a wine shop and I get a haircut. Next I buy a very nice and expensive coat. I walk east and stop at The Angel for a pint of cask ale. This pub is small, dark and carpeted. I love pubs like this. Liz arrives and helps me finish my drink. In a few we head across the street and meet Jessica outside Punjab. A ghoul beckons us in. We catch up some more and tell her about our new Cornwall plans, which delights her. When Bea arrives we head in and feast on curries, naan, chutneys and papadams. We end the meal with pistachio ice cream, Sambuca and a delicious milky sponge. From there we pop next door to Frevd for some cocktails and more good times. Off to bed.<br><br>We check out of the hotel then head for a bacon egg naan roll, chicken liver keema per eedu and chai from Dishoom. To Leicester Square and Heathrow via Picadilly. After what feels like a long time we get an automatic and hit the M25 east.	51.523613, -0.134659	Oct 29, 2022	Nov 1, 2022	Jessica, Bea, Irene	London, Suffolk, Cornwall		51.523613, -0.134659	52.401557, 1.412880	50.556063, -3.964624	50.117086, -5.534246	50.218150, -5.476553	50.474721, -4.728444	50.666818, -4.758471	50.694260, -4.678438						https://photos.app.goo.gl/fPhz5fct8ykq9jMXA
Nashville	Mammoth Locust	287	x	Liz and I have to split. I get on the first flight. Heather picks me up and we catch up for a bit. She tells me about her boyfriend, Kyle, who we'll get to meet tomorrow night. Heather heads to bed and I go to pick up Liz.<br><br>I drop Heather off at work and come back to sleep for a couple more hours. Frodo munches on some dog poo during our walk. Before long we head downtown. Our first stop is Hattie B's for a chicken sandwich and dirty bird fries. We pop over to Elixr for a butterscotch latte with pink peppercorn. I have never yet explored Broadway so we decide to take a little stroll down it. We quickly find a quaint bar with a live band featuring steel guitar. They're pretty great. The drinks are fine. After a bit of trouble getting out of the parking garage (the attendant eventually gives up and let's us out for free) we pick up Heather from work. Back to the place for a clean up. Kyle comes by and we pretty quickly head out. Our first stop is Attaboy. We get right in and order a round. They don't have a menu, but ask some good questions about what we like. The round is pretty solid, with Kyle's spicy rum coke concoction being the clear winner. We're feeling good so we decide to do another round. The second set really slaps. Liz's Tony Rocky Horror tiki guy is especially great. We wrap up there and head over to <span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Locust</span><span class="list__item">The kitchen staff claps for us when we arrive</span><span class="list__item">High ball</span><span class="list__item">Oysters with horseradish and lemon</span><span class="list__item">Txakoli</span><span class="list__item">Tuna belly ham on a cracker with horseradish</span><span class="list__item">Beef tartare with caviar on nori</span><span class="list__item">Grilled mackerel an oniony sour cream</span><span class="list__item">Steamed pork dumplings with chili oil and pickled wakame</span><span class="list__item">Endive with smoked eel</span><span class="list__item">A white from the Canary Islands </span><span class="list__item">Dover sole with a creamy butter sauce and crispy curry potatoes</span><span class="list__item">Shaved ice with passion fruit curd and milky merengue</span></span>Back at Heather's we set up the projector and she makes us a hot apple cider with rye, Amaro Nonino, star anise and cardamom. We settle in for the awesome Rings of Power finale. Kyle heads home and the three of us wrap up the night with picklebacks, chicken skin chips and, in Heather's case, a silica packet.<br><br>We're all feeling a bit tender. Heather and I head to Red Headed Stranger and get some fucking good breakfast tacos & burritos. We take them back and eat them with Heather's beautiful homemade salsa. We hit the road and head north. Before long we're in Kentucky and at Mammoth Cave. We take the Historic tour, which is a two mile, two hour tour through some very open and very closed areas of this truly mammoth cave system. Our guide is a gem, full of cave jokes and a wealth of information about the history of people in this particular hole in the ground. We pick up some tchotchkes and head back down to Nashville. Kyle surprises us by coming by with Briches and we all head to Black Dynasty for killer ramen, gyoza, onigiri, pudding and very good beers. Goodbyes at the airport...until Christgiving.	37.184127 -86.086082	Oct 14, 2022	Oct 16, 2022	Heather & Kyle																https://photos.app.goo.gl/XYfpuTDaRy9adodE9
Chicago	Caryn & Brent	286	x	We catch an early flight, get a ride into town and check into the Blackstone. I work most of the day from the lobby and Liz works from the room. Fast forward to fun times. We get pretty and meet Kyle at Three Dots and a Dash. We start with a shared Sippopotamus, crab rangoon and then a second round of solo drinks. Au Cheval has quite a wait so we pop into Girl & the Goat for some more drinks first. Au Cheval is worth the wait. We get a ridiculous bone marrow on toast with beef cheek marmalade, fries with garlic aioli, hash browns with duck heart gravy, plus burgers and stouts. After there we make for Lizzie McNeill's to meet up with some of the wedding crew for another round. Liz has hit a wall so we call it a night and crash.<br><br>It's a beautiful morning and I walk into the loop for coffee at Inteligencia. On the way back I have a look at the bean. When I get back Liz is just about to leave. We do downstairs where Caryn picks her up—they're heading to the rehearsal—and drops off a bottle of Texas blue corn bourbon that Liz had ordered for me as a gift. I get cleaned up and make my way to COS, where I get some nice things. I stroll through the area and try on a couple of suits at Suit Supply. Before long Liz and I are back in the room. She had picked up Taiwanese pastries for us to snack on. Kyle is nearby so we invite him up for some whiskey and mushroom jerkey. From there we head north. We find a terrace bar, but right as we are about to order Caryn texts and invites us to her parents' place, which is only a few minutes away. We mingle with the crowd there for just a bit before we all walk down to Robert's for a big pizza dinner out on the patio. Just before I'm about to take my first bite my jaw starts hurting very bad. I'm able to chew after a few minutes, but it will be in pain for the rest of this trip. That aside, dinner is very lovely. Liz is feeling sleepy and heads home. A group of about 10 of us decides to head back to the terrace bar for a round. I get to connect with Erin, Kelly, Kyle, Emily, Henning and Fernanda. From there Kyle, Emily and I head up to the Gayborhood for some dancing late into the night.<br><br>I take my time getting up. At 1 I meet Kyle at Lou Malnati's where we nurse our nauseated heads with some pretty good deep dish pizza. After that I head to the Starbucks Reserve for a coffee and then head to the Sheraton lobby. The group builds and soon enough the shuttle bus comes to take us to the country club. After a slight delay on the side of the freeway for the driver to "re-jam"...something, we arrive at the castle on the golf course. The ceremony is sweet and not too long. Liz looks absolutely stunning in her green velvet dress. From there we do all of the fun wedding things and I dance our butts off. At 11:45 the bus takes us back to to the hotel downtown. Most folks head home, but Kyle and I head out for another round of dancing, follow by some late night taco bell antics. I walk home in the mostly quiet downtown.<br><br>I get coffee and cuddle with Liz for a bit before we check out and head to the park. We take in Buckingham Fountain, a Hawthorne tree grove and the bean. A very calm van driver takes us to Chinatown where we meet Andrew at Slurp Slurp. We catch up over dumplings and yummy noodle soups. The hand-shaved noodles are particularly delightful. Next we grab a boba and walk to Ping Tom Park where we sit in the shady grass on the riverbank under a willow and soak in the perfect day. On our walk back I spot a bird sitting in the middle of the sidewalk. We don't see anything physically wrong with him, but he seems very sleepy and let's Liz nudge him onto a sheet of paper. We put him under some bushes and leave him a cap of water. Into Bar 9 where we get to meet Elvis, Andrew's partner, and try some of his treats including mapo fries, General Tso's cauliflower, and ube egg tarts. We also have some nice cocktails made by Alex. Back outside we find our feathered friend has flown the coop, which is the best news we could have hoped for. We catch a ride to the airport and get the last two seats.	41.520680, -87.687082	Sep 29, 2022	Oct 2, 2022	Kyle & Andrew plus a whole bunch of AA folks for wedding times																https://photos.app.goo.gl/BLPzLwQBwyFKbdPt6
White Sands	Dune	285	x	We land in El Paso, get a car and drive north to Las Cruces. On the way up we call Dad to wish him a happy birthday. We head to an abandoned burger stand and motel which now operates as a cocktail bar and taco truck. We're a little bit early, but Dylan takes care of us and provides some very refreshing Bloody Marys. After a sipping for a bit the truck opens up. We get a very good chili relleno burrito plus a chili burger and asada cheese fries. Next we find a 20-foot-tall roadrunner made of tennis shoes and crutches and head easy to White Sands National Park. It's not a very big area and it's quite toasty out, but we manage a couple of stops and climb up a few dunes to take in the stunning, surreal ocean of gypsum. I take a small hike where I discover an array of cute animal and insect tracks. We hit the road back south, grab some flautas from Chico's, and speed to the airport to barely catch the last flight of the day.	32.820110, -106.273848	Aug 28, 2022	Aug 28, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/Zpks4GnNNXWA7ZEG6
Nashville	Grand Ole Rolph and Daughters	284	x	There are many lane closures at the Nashville airport and it takes Heather an hour to get to us. We drive to Dino's for some excellent burgers with animal fries and an alcoholic tomato lemon slushy from the lemon stand out back. Back at Heather's place we talk about dying in caves and head to bed.<br><br>We drop her off at work and head to Biscuit Love for breakfast. Back to the market where Heather gives us a tour. We pick up lavender shortbread, perfume, and $43 worth of peas. Next we head to the Grand Ole Opry for a backstage tour. Nearish by are some antique stores that we check out. Then we pick up Heather from work, head back to her place and I take a nap. Next we have cold brew plus Yellow Chartreuse, get pretty and head to<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Rolf and Daughters</span><span class="list__item">Sour sourdough with seaweed butter</span><span class="list__item">Cantaloupe with guanciale</span><span class="list__item">Stuffed squash blossom with bravas</span><span class="list__item">Watermelon with fish sauce and toasted cashew</span><span class="list__item">Potatoes with bone marrow and fennel</span><span class="list__item">Beef tartare with nduja</span><span class="list__item">Kale ceasar</span><span class="list__item">Corn pepper </span><span class="list__item">Rigatoni pork ragu</span><span class="list__item">Buccatini with uni butter</span><span class="list__item">Olive oil ice cream with peaches</span><span class="list__item">Chocolate tarte with currant</span></span>SNL and ranch water.<br><br>Heather makes us incredible pancakes with fried eggs and seared "sack sausage", Thomas' homemade take on salami. We drop Heather off at work, then head back to her place and tidy up a bit. Next to Starlight Vintage where I find some very cute clothes. Onto Frist for a cool exhibit on light featuring some Turell. We pick Heather back up and head back to her place for some sake	36.206813, -86.692097	Aug 12, 2022	Aug 14, 2022	Heather																https://photos.app.goo.gl/2Kuw4vBqjW3tEhXY7
Palm Springs	Jim	283		To Fuzion Five for a yummy bun cha and pho chin. Next we bounce around downtown to check out the Shag store plus a few antique shops. We've got a few hours to kill before we pick up Justin and Uncle Michael from the airport so we see Nope in a local theater. We've still got a bit more time to kill so we pop into Tonga Hut for some yummy cocktails. Airport. Pizza.<br><br>We head to the Lutheran Church for Jim's funeral. The religious part is weird, but a few folks play touching live music and others share funny stories. We lunch at Mario's, an Italian-American place with an apparently killer Chinese chicken salad. Back for a nap. Mom & Howard come over and we share some cocktails. Soon I whip up a Mexican meal and we spend the evening chatting away over wine and ice cream sandwiches.<br><br>I do a bit of yoga in the grass behind the house that clearly is only meant for looking at. Justin and I take a good long walk around the neighborhood. I make bacon & eggs for the group. Before long we head to the Elk's Lodge for Jim's Celebration of Life. They do some ritual stuff, I play Somewhere Over the Rainbow (with a special twist for Jim) and quite a few people share funny stories. We all hang for a good couple of hours and have a very nice time. The group of us spends the rest of the evening at Mom's. Justin puts on a soccer game and Liz starts cleaning the kitchen sink. We soon discover that her faucet is quite corroded and is in need of a replacement. A few hours and a trip to Home Depot later mom has a pretty new faucet installed.<br><br>Up at 4 to catch our flight home.	33.712720, -116.252219	Aug 4, 2022	Aug 7, 2022	Mom, Justin, Uncle Michael																
Los Angeles	Mambo Craze	282	x	It's late when we land in Orange County. We drive to Pizzana and get there a few minutes after they close, but they are super nice and still give us the pizza plus a free piece of chocolate cake. The pizza is cacio e pepe with dollops of parmeseana crema. The cake is soft and tastes of olive oil. We eat in the car and then drive to Tiki Ti. We drink some yummy, slightly divey drinks and get a cute lantern mug. We finish the pizza in the car and then head to the hotel to crash.<br><br>I sleep in a bit. When we're up and ready we head to Courage Bagels. We wait for at least 45 minutes, but this place is worth it. We get a half order of Running through the garden, one with crème frâiche and caviar, and a sandwich with sardines plus some very yummy coffees. These are the best bagels. We pop into Pygmy Hippo Shop, the LA Farmers Market and Urth Cafe for a look around. No sign of Russell. To Funnel Mill in Santa Monica for cacao nib cold brew and house chai. We walk to Target for some supplies and then make our way to<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Rustic Canyon</span><span class="list__item">A big hunk of bread and salty cultured butter</span><span class="list__item">Endive with chewy strawberry and roasted pecans</span><span class="list__item">Shrimp with hazelnut sauce</span><span class="list__item">Green beans with smoked garlic and macadamia</span><span class="list__item">Linguine with chanterelle</span><span class="list__item">Koji cured pork chop with tarragon, roe and currant cream sauce</span></span>From dinner we head back to the hotel to digest and get pretty. Onto Cicada for Mambo Craze, a live throwback Latin Music dance party with burlesque dancers, including a cyr wheel performance by none other than Tosca. The music is grooving, the venue is a stunning deco hall, the crowd is beautiful and the performers are mesmerizing. Near midnight we walk the three minutes over to Clifton's, but the steep cover and club vibe turn us home instead. As we're walking back we pass the Cicada club again and spot none other than Tosca waiting for a cab on the street. We say hi, give our praises chat with her for a few minutes. She is goofy and down to earth and very cool. Back in room Liz puts on a cute outfit and shows it off. As I lie down for bed I get very itchy and within a couple of minutes discover I have hives all over my neck and dotted elsewhere.<br><br>We call Heather to wish her a very happy birthday. Liz reveals her secret plan, complete with reservations already made to Rolf and Daughters, to come out in a couple of weeks. We don't quite have time for the breakfast place Liz had planned, so we grab some buffet from downstairs and head over to Bob Baker's Marionette Theater for a magical hour of Mexican-inspired song and dance by an array of fascinating string-bound creatures. Just before the show starts I spot someone who looks suspiciously like Elijah Wood sitting across from us. At one point he lets out a laugh and my suspicion is confirmed. After the show I give him a quick gush of praise, which he took very kindly. Next stop is the John Soden House, a stunning FLW build. It's an private building, but the view from the front is enough to give us an even greater appreciation of the master of space and angles. Next we head south a bit to Holbox some delicious Mexican seafood dishes. We park the car back by the hotel and climb the hill to MOCA for some great large-scale contemporary works. After a rest up in the hotel we head to <span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Here's Looking at You</span><span class="list__item">Some very good wines and later a Mexican rum cocktail with honeydew and lime</span><span class="list__item">Wild hawaiian ahi tuna, fennel, raspberry, tarragon, pepita dukkah</span><span class="list__item">Duck hearts, beni shoga, kewpie, lemon, chili</span><span class="list__item">Chicken liver, apricot jam, black pepper, b&g bread</span><span class="list__item">Sprouted broccoli, ginger, h.o.p., seeds, nuts</span><span class="list__item">Steak tartare, red chili, scallions, tamari, yolk, turnip</span><span class="list__item">Roasted chestnut mochi, coconut, muscovado, halvah</span></span>We're both pretty wiped so we head straight to the hotel and crash.<br><br>We had made coffee plans with Nelly, but she had to cancel. The upside is that we're up early and head to Courage for a second round. The bagels are pure fucking perfection. After those babies we head south for a while to Watts Towers, a series of mosaic clad structures build by an Italian immigrant over a period of thirty years. We take those in for a bit, I kiss Liz on the face and we move on. Next stop is Wayfarers chapel, a geometric seaside sacred space designed by none other than Frank Lloyd Wright. Up the coast a bit for some yummy Philz Coffee and then west to Manhattan Beach where we sit in the sand and enjoy our various food leftovers with most of a bottle of wine. It is a lovely ending to a lovely trip. 	33.938816, -118.241991	Jul 30, 2022	Aug 1, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/V5ZAQ7uX6WShDc8Z6
Las Vegas	What a Drag	281	x	Rob & Tony drive us to the airport and we catch the first flight of the day. We share a sad bagel sandwich and watery cold brew. On the plane I catch up on Stranger Things. We land and get the bus to the Marriott about a mile east of the strip. They're still not ready for us so we hang for a few and get a ride to Carnitas Don Claudio in the way northwest. Our driver sings a bit of Zeppelin karaoke in the car for us. At Don we dine on quesabirria tacos and a carnitas burrito. They are stupid good. We next head to Charleston Antique Mall and Moondog Records for antiques and records. After that is Frankie's for Frankie's. We sip three very delicious drinks and reek of smoke by the end of it. To the hotel. Liz orders Thai from Lotus of Siam and I pop down the street to pick it up. We snack on that for a few before heading to OmegaMart. We spend almost four hours exploring the incredible space. It is very well done and the whole Area 15 compound is packed.<br><br>We take our time getting up, grab some buffet, move over to Flamingo, and walk to Akhob. Our guides are lovely and even give us a few extra minutes as they can tell we're really into it. The experience is serene and meditative. Each color gives me a unique feeling and plays on my eyes in different ways. We eat yummy cold curry leftovers on a mall couch then catch a ride to the Office of Collecting and Design. We spend the next 90 minutes looking through the small-ish room packed with hidden treasures, trinkets, tchotchkes, gems, doll parts, match boxes, dice, statues, bones, googley eyes, letters, miniature tools, mirrors, containers, slides, ice cream cones, Christmas trees, glasses and a whole lot more. The best part of all is Jessica, the curator and our docent who we both just absolutely hit it off with. She and Liz probably swapped 15 recommendations for museums and restaurants around the world. We head back to the Flamingo and, after a daunting line at the check-in desk, get into our room. Before long we head downstairs to meet the boys. We're short on time so we opt for In-N-Out and then take it up to the room to eat. For dessert we share Aperol Spritzes. Next we get real pretty and meet them again downstairs in front of RuPaul's Drag Race. The show is very good, though at 90 minutes, a bit on the short side. Afterward we stop by the casino bar for a couple more drinks, after which Liz and I are quite drunk. After quickly loosing a couple of rounds of Roulette it's 3 a.m. Dallas time and we finally call it a night.<br><br>I find this mysterious black crumbly stuff on the bed. Liz informs me that last night we got chocolate cake from the cake vending machine on our way back to the room last night and ate it in bed. Liz nurses a moderate hangover for much of the day. I pop down to Goorin and buy a nice sun hat. I attempt the pool, but the club vibe is strong and I'm not feeling it. At 4 we meet the boys in their room for a Hypnotiq spritz. Soon we head to Golden Tiki for some yummy drinks and lots of delicious snacks. Next we head downtown and get in a quick tour of the Neon museum. It is oppressively hot. We pop down to Freemont, I investigate some fake pot, and we step in to Circa where we proceed to give them money for nothing. We pick up more of that tropical blue elixir and head back to the hotel for a another round. We call it a night at a much more reasonable 11 p.m.<br><br>After a Starbucks run we check out, look at the flamingos and then meet Rob & Tony in their room. They rented a car so we get that and head out. We try for Chilly Jilly's, but there's no indoor seating, so we opt for some decent Mexican. Our next stop is Hoover Dam. It is stunning, but we can only handle about ten minutes in the heat before we're all done. Back in Boulder City we stop by Milos for a bottle of wine before they drop us off at the airport.	36.116270, -115.172290	Jul 9, 2022	Jul 12, 2022	Rob & Tony																https://photos.app.goo.gl/kopxgnWhqQ5PHSGc6
Oklahoma City	A OK	280	x	After work we hop on 35 and drive north for 192 miles, with a stop for a Big Mac along the way. We check into the hotel, I lie down for about three minutes and then we head to the Beer City Music Hall for<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Belle and Sebastian</span><span class="list__item">Dog on Wheels</span><span class="list__item">I'm a Cukoo</span><span class="list__item">Unnecessary Drama</span><span class="list__item">Young and Stupid</span><span class="list__item">Like Dylan in the Movies</span><span class="list__item">If She Wants Me</span><span class="list__item">I Want the World to Stop</span><span class="list__item">Piazza, New York Catcher</span><span class="list__item">If They're Shooting at You</span><span class="list__item">Reclaim the Night</span><span class="list__item">Funny Little Frog</span><span class="list__item">Jonathan Davis</span><span class="list__item">Simple Things</span><span class="list__item">The Boy with the Arab Strap</span><span class="list__item">Dear Catastrophe Caitress</span><span class="list__item">Sleep the Clock Around</span><span class="list__item">(encore)</span><span class="list__item">String Bean Jean</span><span class="list__item">Another Sunny Day</span></span>The show is beautiful. We stop by Taco Bell for some cheeky stuff and eat in bed.<br><br>The hotel buffet is pretty good and our server is very nice. In the elevator I chat with some tattoo artists who are here for the convention. I try on my new high-wasted trousers with clogs and feel fab. Our first stop out is to Coffee Slingers for a Jalapeno Business and a cold brew with coconut milk. From there we pop into a few shops. Liz picks up a Meowboys shirt and I earrings from Shop Good. As we're driving we pass a pretty rainbow colored building and decide to stop in. It's called Craig's Curious Emporium. It's sort of like a big gay Spencer's and a bit of a blast from the '90s. The staff are all very lovely and give us some good recommendations. Next we stop by Fabric Factory and grab some swatches. At Dead People's Stuff I chat with a charming woodworker and a teenage girl compliments my outfit. To Big Truck Tacos for some very good tacos and then we check into Classen Inn Motel, which is very charming. In a few we head to RETROKC and then Trolley Stop where Liz picks out Are We Not Men. Back to the motel for a bit. I hem my trousers, we take some cute pics and then head to a Burlesque show. I'm not so much a fan of the MCs Adele and Bryan, but there are some very good performances including a non-binary aerialist and a Mohawk burlesque artist. Next we head to the gayborhood and pop into The Boom where we catch the end of a drag show. Taco Bell for a very late dinner.<br><br>I pick up Elemental Coffee and we enjoy it with a banana walnut cardamom muffin at the motel. Next to Factory Obscura, which is pretty cool and feels a lot like Meow Wolf. We hit the road towards home, but make a pit stop in Norman at The Diner for a great burrito and a burger. When we get home Liz discoveres she has COVID.	35.492927, -97.516847	Jun 10, 2022	Jun 12, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/fB7zkvNcPpZXocmm7
Marfa	Big Marfa	279	x	Our first stop is the Prada Marfa, which is about 30 min west of town. As we're wrapping up taking some photos of it a fun group rolls up, literally, on roller skates and they snap some sweet shots of us. As we head back into town we stop at a few other roadside attractions, including some giant giant Giant stars cutouts and a Stardust billboard. It's already 3 when we cruise into town and it seems things will be shutting down pretty soon, so we hit up a few main street shops before they shutter up for the night. I get a sweet vintage chore coat and a boxy tee. From there we check into El Cosmico, a motley collection for teepees, yurts, army huts, tents and vintage RVs; the last of which we have booked for the evening. We settle in and spend a good while getting cool with the help of the A/C and setting sun. In an hour or two we are feeling peckish. Not much appears to be open, but we head to Lost Horse Saloon, which seems close and cheap at least. It turns out to be both of those things as well as incredibly delicious. We get some of the best and freshest guac I've had since Barrio Queen in the mid teens and savory pulled pork tacos. Mid-meal in walks some folks we sat next to at Long Draw and we chat it up with them for a bit. They encourage us to visit their tiny town outside of San Antonio, Bandera. From there we head to Marfa Open to hear some live music, but as we pull up things aren't really getting started yet and we're not in the mood for a late night, so we opt to head back to El Cosmico, take in the sunset from the hammocks and watch Giant from our private porch. When it's fully dark I take long-exposure photos of the teepees and stars.<br><br>I make coffee and shower on the deck before we check out. We first stop by Marfa Burrito for some especially good ones with lardy beans. Next we sit at Do Your Own Thing for some coffee and chats with our burrito neighbors. Town is pretty closed down today so we hit the road. We drive north past Fort Davis through the gorgeously phallic landscape. The man at the vintage shop yesterday recommended we stop at Balmorhea State Park for a dip in the 4x version of Barton Springs, but it's already full for the day so we turn east towards home.	30.309942, -104.017721	May 29, 2022	May 30, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/arRUBU19Uqu5oeWL7
Terglingua	Big Marfa	278	x	After work we hit the road and drive west for six hours. At midnight we stop at a very nice Fairfield in Monahans.<br><br>Biscuits and gravy for breakfast. We grab a big cold brew and some cinnamon beginets from PJs and head south. The land starts out incredibly flat and mostly barren, but within an hour we encounter rolling hills, which climb their way up to mountains. We enter the park and make for the Fossil Discovery Exhibit. It tells of the long history of this region from being the floor of a shallow sea, to a tropical wetland, to today via the many impressive fossils that have been found in the park. It's only just past 11, but it is already incredibly hot outside. We can only handle being out in the covered structure for about 20 minutes. Back in the car, we head to the Rio Grande Village Nature Trail at the southeastern edge of the park. The actual trails are just too long for us to brave in this heat, but we stop for a couple of minutes at a picnic area just off the river. Someone has left out some cute copper wire figurines for sale and we pick up an ocotillo with a roadrunner next to it. It looks like there was a big fire through here recently and the whole bank area is covered in ash. It's a bit too steep and sandy for Liz, but I slide down the bank to get to the water. It's more of a stream than a river and the water is surprisingly warm in temperature. We stop at another pretty lookout spot before heading west to the hotel. In an hour we're at Willow House; a minimalist britalist collection of casitas outside of Terlingua. It's quaint and gorgeous. The room is cool and dark and smells of geranium. After saying hi to the Cuban managers in the main house we settle in for a quick lie down...an hour or so later we both have to force ourselves out of the sun induced coma we seem to have fallen into. When we get up we head to Long Draw Pizza for mozzarella sticks, pizza and beer. It's quaint and the pizza is good as heck. Back to the hotel for some pretty pictures in the golden hour and then some wine. When the sky is turning dark we head back outside and lie on a big hanging bed and watch the stars come out.<br><br>We get up moderately early, make some sandwiches and hit the road. We make for the Chiso Basin Visitors Center and before long are winding our way around the Loop. We don't make the full loop as Liz is already turning quite red, but we get plenty of great sights including some deer, big stink bugs, a snek and a whole ton of beautiful plants and mountains. We take her back to the car and then I head back out to do the Window Loop Trail. On my way I chat a bit with some very lovely Rangers. I like Rangers. After the short, but photogenic, loop we drive a few more and head to the Lost Mine Trail. We start it together, though after about 15 minutes Liz is turning red again and decides to head back. I go on for another 15 or so until I am able to straddle the ridge. Back down I see that she is already battling an oncoming migraine. She lies down while I drive us the hour or so to Santa Elena Canyon. She, unfortunately, is still feeling pretty rough and decides it's best to stay in the car. I make my way down to the extrememly dry and cracked riverbed and take in the absolutely awe-inspiring views. I hike about 10 minutes into the ominous canyon before turning back. We're both hot and tired and it's well into the day now so we decide to head back. We both nap for a bit and, once we're getting good and hungry, I head back to Long Draw to pick up another delicious pizza, this time with some cheesy bread sticks. We monch and then sit out back to watch the sun set while drinking the pinot noir we picked up in Portland. It is very dang good. Once it gets dark we head back in an put on a couple episodes of Better Call Saul. After a good touch we fall immediately asleep. I had set an alarm for 3 a.m. to hopefully catch the Milky Way, but it's too hazy out so back to bed.<br><br>We get dolled up real cute and take some nice photos before checking out. We hit the road north and then west towards Marfa.	29.268675, -103.303370	May 26, 2022	May 29, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/arRUBU19Uqu5oeWL7
Nashville	Seats	277	x	We hit the road after work on Friday. Traffic getting out of Dallas is garbage. We eat Whataburger and spend the night in Memphis.<br><br>We head straight for imogen and willie in Nashville, where a kind man helps me pick out nice denim. To the Farmer's Market where Heather gives us a key and then to the southern V for fake chicken fried chicken and a tuna melt. We drop our bags off at Heather's and then head to Paddywax where we make some very nice smelling candles. Back to Heather's for some milk punch and catching up. We hear about her work news, which sounds pretty shitty, and her trip to Poland, which sounded pretty wild. After some more drinks and catching up we make for<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Peninsula</span><span class="list__item">Woody sherry</span><span class="list__item">Strawberry and pine oil broth</span><span class="list__item">Puffed chicken skin with chicken fat cream</span><span class="list__item">Sweetbreads that tasted like buttered popcorn</span><span class="list__item">Charred eggplant with browned butter and salted cream</span><span class="list__item">Kohlrabi with elderflower and horseradish</span><span class="list__item">Maitake with white chocolate and suterberry</span><span class="list__item">Iberico pressa with pickled gooseberries, maitake sauce, a thick slice of chorizo, and pressed potatoes with green peppercorn bechamel</span><span class="list__item">Yummy macerated wine</span><span class="list__item">Passion fruit semifredo with charred basil and house Pringles</span></span>It was a very solid meal. Back at Heather's we drink Jannamico and eat strawberry cake.<br><br>Up and to The Pancake Pantry for Santa Fe cornmeal savory pancakes and a classic grand slam thing. The "scramble" eggs are silky and folded. Next we stop by Five Daughters to pick up some not cronuts for the road. 	36.219774, -86.697096	May 6, 2022	May 8, 2022																	
Chicago	Wedding Crashing	276	x	We wake at 3 and make it on the first flight of the day. I get a cold brew from a shop by the baggage claim carousel that tastes like fermenting piss. We get the train to the loop, grab better coffees and check in to the hotel. We work a whole bunch, I get promoted to manager and we grab lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant in the back of a jewelry shop. After work we get a ride to COS where I get a couple of nice silky polo shirts. A few minutes south to gawk at the corncobs. Karen and Brent are in town doing some wedding prep this weekend and they are hanging at her mom's house, which is only a 15-minute walk from here. We arrive at their lovely townhouse on the Chicago River, share wine with cold pizza and chat four hours about wedding planning, docudramas and LSD Baguettes. Our Uber cancels so we walk the 35 minutes back to the hotel.<br><br>More coffee and Impossible sandwiches. We relax and cuddle our way through the morning. At noon Ben & Kaori come by. We catch up in the room for just a few before getting a ride to Lao Peng You, a Chinese restaurant Liz doesn't remember how she found. The place is charming and our server is a gem. The food is all stupid good. Silky tofu in chili oil and vinegar, chilled eggplant, Dan Dan noodles, beef dumpling soup, Taiwanese beef noodles. We are all very happy. We pop into the Ukrainian  The weather is perfect so we decide to stroll a while. I talk with mom on the phone for a few and somehow fall down. Ben shows us a shit fountain. Liz spots a Philz Coffee, so we see stop in for a couple of mojito drinks. Our timing is great and we have a great view of the rainstorm that passes by. Now we're in Wicker Park and we make our way down the street. They show us the Wicker Park Scramble before taking us up to the 606, which is basically a copy of the High Line in Nee York. There are flowers everywhere. The tulips and pear trees are especially happy right now. We loop back down and pop into Royal Palms, a shuffle board bar designed to feel like an Olympic swimming pool. We do cocktails, prom selfies, a ring swing game, and connect four. Back down the road to Big Star for Mexican. We all catch the blue line downtown and part ways. They are great and we're happy to have been able to spend this time together. In discussion our appreciation for them, Liz gives some apt adjectives. Ben: measured & playful. Kaori: sassy & electric. Back to the hotel for a quick change and then we catch the pink line to...<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Aviary</span><span class="list__item">I'm Blue: Lemon, blueberry, coconut chai, port and gin with a caviar and cucumber slushie oyster</span><span class="list__item">Zombie Panda: lychee, pisco, raspberry liqueur ice balls with corn fritters</span><span class="list__item">Banana, curry and gin with mushroom soup and cheesy bread</span><span class="list__item">Torched Campari over rye, apple brandy, apricot liqueur, Averna, bitters with duck confit, celeriac, grape and mustard</span><span class="list__item">Truffle explosion.

Around noon we get a bus to meet Ben and Kaori at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder. Most of the staff seems to be in a pretty bad mood, but our server has enough charisma to counter it. He recommends the Mediterranean Bread, which is a big NY pizza dough covered in butter and herbs. We each also get a pizza pot pie, which I a pizza made inverted in a bowl with the crust on top and then flipped back over when served. It is pretty darn good and has a whole lot of cheese. From there we walk east to the Lincoln Park zoo where we say hi to the seals, snow leopards and a few types of primate including a troop of gorillas. The snow leopards are particularly majestic. We say goodbye to some sweet humans and make our way first to the hotel to get our bags and then to the airport. We don't make our first flight so we hang in the lounge for a bit and chat with Natalie, who is coming back from Paris.	41.913081 -87.681862	Apr 29, 2022	May 1, 2022	Ben & Kaori, Caryn & Brent																https://photos.app.goo.gl/XVoiuA92NBsphS6Z9
Bentonville	Pleasant Surprise	275	x	I make a coconut maple cold brew with almond butter toast and then we get on a plane to Arkansas. I get about 30 minutes into Spiderman: No Way Home and I really like it so far. Avis upgrades us to a fancy Chrysler and we drive into down. We aim for Onyx Coffee Lab, which is located right in the historic downtown. We, very fortuitously, arrive right in the middle of the first Bentonville Farmer's Market of the year. The weather is gorgeous and there's a wonderfully diverse crowd. I pick up a nice plate, which I intend to use for guitar picks and such. Into Onyx where we pick up some beautiful weird coffee drinks plus a breakfast sandwich and a toasted pimento cheese sandwich with tomato jam. We pop into Block Street Records where I pick up a Bronski Beat LP. Next we head to Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Our first stop on site is Frank Lloyd Wright's Bachman-Wilson House. It is the work of a master of space, shapes, lines and materials. On the art walk we take in Kusama Narcissus Balls, a Bourgeois spider and a Turrell Skyspace. Inside the museum for early American art, light-inspired works, modern, contemporary, and loads of very good art. We spend over two hours taking it all in. I pop into Sally for a quick store visit and then we head to the hotel for a quick lie down before making our way to dinner at Preacher's Son. Beets with ricotta. Kale Caesar. Oysters with mingionette. Burrata on brioche with fig compote and pine nut butter. Roasted cauliflower with whipped cheddar, cashew and benne seed. We walk downstairs for the tiki popup at Undercroft. It takes them a good while to get us a menu and then another good while to come back and take our order. The drinks are just okay, but we have a nice chat. We opt not to do the dive bar and instead head back to the hotel for some nice cuddles.<br><br>Up at 4:30 and we head out.	36.378222, -94.206331	Apr 9, 2022	Apr 9, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/dickTXhw1GqGEepq8
Nashville	Steak & Spark	274	x	Context: seeing Sparks in Portland was so good that we wanted to see them again and are able to make this Nashville show with Heather, who already has tickets for it. We get up at 4:30 to catch an early flight, which we later discover was a very good idea as all of the other flights are either packed or canceled. We work for a bit from the airport and then Heather picks us up and takes us back to her place. We give Frodo some smooches and do our occupation. Soon Heather makes us some killer kimchi quesidillas with her homemade kimchi and the tortillas we brought for her. When work is done we celebrate first with a spicy tepache kombucha. Soon we're working on some great and funky pet nats. For dinner Heather decided to make the tomahawk steak she got from a local farmer. While we're waiting she makes some stupidly good asparagus. She slow roasts and reverse sears the meat. For sides she does mashed potatoes and parsnip plus crispy Brussels Sprouts. It is the No 1 steak in heaven. I'm so glad we are able to eat her cooking. She's really good at it. Dessert is Braulio floats.<br><br>Most of today is uneventful as we work. For lunch I ride Heather's bike to Joyland and pick up excellent burgers plus a chocolate malt shake. At the end of that time Heather gets home and we all get pretty and green. Heather has on her new amazing velvet eyeball dress, Liz is sporting her sexy classy caselvitrano dress and I've got angst in my pants.

Inks Lake State Park	Camping	273	x	After work I drive down to the Plunkett house. I arrive at 9 they have a dinner of Bangers and Mash with Guinness ready for me.<br><br>I work in the morning while Justin gets supplies ready. At around 2 we head West. Inks Lake Park is only a little over an hour away, deep in the hill country. We get to our spot and get set up. We set up the tent, two hammocks, some chairs, tables, and the grill. It feels pretty good. After testing out the hammocks for a bit we do a short hike to Devil's Waterhole. The weather is great. Back at the camp we play Frisbee for a bit and then get started on our dinner of hot dogs and beans. We eat just as the sun is setting and it's very beautiful. There's a fire ban due to the high winds and it's getting cold quickly so we clean up and head in the tent for a few rounds of Scattegories. We brave the cold to fire up the grill and make s'mores and a toasted Twinkie before calling it a night.<br><br>We wake up at around 9. It's chilly out, but the sun feels good. Justin makes some strong coffee and we sit in the sun for a bit to wake up and warm up. Next he makes pancakes and then we get cleaned up. We decide to do a combo hike of the Fisherman's Trails plus the Lakes Trail. It's a little over two miles total. It's quite pretty though, while the hiking isn't challenging, the sun quickly builds in its intensity and we're all feeling pretty toasty. Back at the car we're feeling thirsty and hungry sl we head back into Burnet to pick up salads from HEB. We sack on those back at the site and relax in the hammocks for a bit. I teach Nixon how to play Azul an he kicks my butt. After another round of Frisbee we cook up some very yummy chicken fajitas that Danielle prepped for us. Then a quick clean up and we head just a bit down the road to where Justin booked us a "Full Moon Hike" with a local park ranger. While there (spoiler) was no full moon on the hike, Jaime did take us on a very informative and beautiful tour of the Pacan Flat loop. We caught sunset right at the peak, had a meditation during dusk, and used our UV lights to spot quite a few scorpions and centipedes. Tonight is much warmer than last night and it's very pleasant to be out after dark. We can see many stars in the sky. Back at camp we sip bourbon and make a couple of rounds of s'mores before heading to bed.<br><br>We all wake up around 8. After some coffee we decided to try our luck on the kayaks. We get on and paddle over to the Devil's Waterhole, which is nice and quaint. We spot a few geese and turtles along the way. Heading back, we encounter a few geese who seem to be in some type of argument. Once back, we fire up the grills for make more coffee plus scrambled eggs, breakfast sausages, and home fries. We're cutting it pretty close to checkout time so we quickly load the car and head back to Round Rock.	30.737268, -98.369057	Mar 17, 2022	Mar 20, 2022	The Plunkett Family																https://photos.app.goo.gl/so35xAUH6e6AdDDD7
Portland	Le Spark Booth	272	x	Flights are already packed. We get up at 3:45 to try for a Delta zed to SLC and don't make it. After a chik fil-a breakfast we make an Alaskan flight to Seattle. I sit next to Josh from Anchorage and we chat for probably three hours about deep stuff. I hope we meet again. Connections don't look good so we get a bus down to Portland. I code on the ride and a few hours later we are in the city of ghost trees. There are many tents on the sidewalks. To the hotel for a quick clean up, to Well-Spent Market for wine and to...<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Le Pigeon</span><span class="list__item">Corned Beef Tongue wasabi, beet mostarda, green apple crema</span><span class="list__item">Smoked Duck Confit à l'Orange, green curry barley, brussels sprouts, kumquat honey mustard</span><span class="list__item">Kombu Glazed Monkfish, pork skin peas, lobster fennel salad, tarragon seaweed pistou</span><span class="list__item">Rack of Lamb, glazed carrots, merguez, fregola, charred cabbage, walnut cream</span><span class="list__item">Baileys Bombolone dark cherry bavarian, stracciatella semifreddo, tejas de almendra & Foie Gras Profiterole</span></span>Dinner is incredible and every dish is complex and balanced. Our driver has a dog giving us sweet eyes from the front seat. He tells us about some of the best bike racks in Portland including one in front of an orthodontist's office that looks like crooked teeth with braces. We arrive at Hale Pele. It's super packed, but we manage to get seated pretty quickly. We get one big creamy guava baby and a spicy cold brew boy. We split one more sasparilla guy and walk around in the cold for a bit before catching a ride to Alibi. I am immediately reminded very much of Frankie's. It is divey, the booths are rounded with red vinyl, and there's karaoke going on in the back room. Liz snags a table. I put our names on the list and order a Banana Hammock, a Jungle Bird and an order of Crab Rangoon. The drinks taste as I expected, which is not as good as Frankie's. We hang around and play some Sqardle. We don't get called up to sing.<br><br>We wake up late and head to Heart. On our way there we pass a man standing bent over with needles at his feet. The coffees and cardamom bun are pretty good, but no La Cabre. To Whole Foods for garlic sauce and then to World Foods for some pretty local wines. Back to the hotel to drop stuff off and take a COVID test before getting a ride to Devil-ish Little Things Museum. Marion and her two dogs give us a detailed tour of this playful, devilish little wonderland, which features cigar holders, lighters, inkwells, tobacco holders, ashtrays, German wool stitchings, homemade ceramics, gambling paraphernalia, Christmas ornaments, paper mache masks, drinkware, erotic art, books, beadwork, a tiki bar, and many other objects featuring devils, deamons, Krampuses along with other hooved & horned creatures. We stop downtown to pop into Cargo where we pick up a paper mache kitsune mask for Marlow before heading to Bethany to visit with the Booths. Marlow meows and Jolene warms my lap while we sit out back, enjoy some Japanese pastries plus Ryan's homemade coconut cream cake and share our news and ideas. Marlow shows Liz the sprouts coming up through the soil. Soon they take us on a walk where Marlow picks flowers for Liz and they then give us a tour of the home. Back to the hotel for a change and quick meditation before walking to Bamboo Sushi for a bunch of good sushi. We run back to the hotel quickly to drop off the leftovers and then head to McMenamins Crystal Ballroom for...<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Sparks</span><span class="list__item">May We Start</span><span class="list__item">I've Got Angst in My Pants</span><span class="list__item">Tips for Teens</span><span class="list__item">Under the Table With Her</span><span class="list__item">Get in the Swing</span><span class="list__item">I Married Myself</span><span class="list__item">I Predict</span><span class="list__item">Wonder Girl</span><span class="list__item">Stravinsky's Only Hit</span><span class="list__item">Shopping Mall of Love</span><span class="list__item">Johnny Delusional</span><span class="list__item">We Love Each Other So Much</span><span class="list__item">Edith Piaf Said it Better</span><span class="list__item">Lawnmower</span><span class="list__item">Music That You Can Dance To</span><span class="list__item">Rhythm Theif</span><span class="list__item">Mother Nature</span><span class="list__item">When do I get to Sing My Way</span><span class="list__item">My Baby's Taking Me Home</span><span class="list__item">No 1 Song in Heaven</span><span class="list__item">This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us</span><span class="list__item">(Encore)</span><span class="list__item">Suburban Homeboy</span><span class="list__item">All That</span></span>Back at the hotel we open a bottle of red, but don't get very far into it before we crash.<br><br>Up early to work. Starbucks for some of that. At 11 we head to Never for a licorice oat latte and a yuzu coconut latte, both of which are very yummy. We then grab a couple slices of Sizzle Pie to go and head back to the room for that with the rest of the wine and sushi from last night. Halfway through the show last night we decided we want to see Sparks again so we chat with Heather and plan a trip to Nashville for next Tuesday to catch a show with her. After work I pick up some belts and underwear before we catch a bus to Matt's BBQ Tacos. We have an elevated Taco Bell taco supreme and it is truly supreme. Also there's a yummy pork taco plus queso and beans. We run in the rain to catch a bus and then another bus and, in a few more hours, are in Seattle. At the airport curb a man literally runs up to us, shows us a wad of bills in his hand, and asks if we are getting a ride into the city. After we inform him we're heading into, not out of, the airport. He then runs out to the street, cussing loudly about $10,000 and waves his wad of cash at cars passing by. In the airport we eat a free (thanks to Priority Pass) Caesar salad with really good smoked chicken and a bad piece of apple pie because it's Pi day.	45.522777, -122.684889	Mar 12, 2022	Mar 14, 2022	The Booth Family																https://photos.app.goo.gl/pPu3FG8nnd55kAvQ7
New York	The Beautiful People	271	x	We land at LaGuardia. It's almost midnight when we catch a ride to Washington Heights. Sean, Cori and Irma meet us downstairs. We hug and smell each other. Though it's already late we stay up for probably an hour an a half chatting about family, animals, speakers, plants, assertive old men in Washington Heights, and chocolate.<br><br>Irma is sweet and very cuddly with me. Sean first makes some pretty okay coffee and then makes some incredibly good coffee. Cori heads into the back room as she is working today. Liz has a migraine coming on so we give her some meds and then Sean and I head to The Uptown Garrison for a cardamom orange zest latte and chicken nuggets & waffles. Before long Liz is feeling mostly better. Soon the three of us catch a train to the upper Upper West Side and head to Absolute Bagels. My bagel is an everything with cream cheese that is crispy, chewy, a little bready and not too puffy with gloopy, creamy cheese. Liz's nova sandwich on everything is so good that she does a very rare thing and asks to have more than her standard 50% split. She is glowing. Another train takes us to Union Station. I buy a ramps and a dandelion kimchi at the farmer's market. Whole Foods for coconut water. We pass by Joe's Pizza, which Sean says is one of his favorite slices in town, so we pop in and split a triangle of cheese three ways. A few minutes southeast is La Cabra where Ian serves us cold brew and a selection of pastries: cardamom bun, rye tart, orange marmalade & chocolate ganache donut and a chocolate mousse. We talk about family politics and politics. Sean takes us to his office for a pee. A bit further on we pop into Stick With Me for pretty treats. Just around the corner is Mother's Ruin so we sit down for some very drinkable cocktails. Cori shows up and gets a drink before we head to Joe's Shanghai in The Bowery. We have to stand out in the cold for not too awful long before sitting down for all around fabulous soup dumplings, General Tso's chicken, Szechuan beef, and crispy duck. They bring us sliced oranges with the check. We walk into Soho and pick up some desserts from Little Cupcake Bakery. The woman sitting across from us on the train lights up a cigarette. Back at the apartment we eat yummy strawberry cake and banana loaf.<br><br>Sean makes us very nice coffee from the beans he bought yesterday. Cori makes a big beautiful Dutch Baby with fried eggs and turkey bacon. Sean tells us about his private geometry. We take the train downtown, stop by Blank Street for for a cheese amann and coffee. Onto the Whitney Museum for the 5th floor craft exhibit. Armando gives us a wildly entertaining and informative tour of some of his favorite pieces in the gallery. A highlight is the life-size kitchen entirely encrusted in glass beads by Liza Lou. It is beautiful and powerful. I take some nice photos of Sean against the backdrop of the city and then we head up to Women and Abstraction, which features some very lovely works including a single curvy line, which the four of us especially appreciate. We grab another slice of Joe's, catch a train back home, get pretty and then head for dinner at Honey Badger. The neighborhood is not particularly nice, the restaurant is completely empty and we are sat in slightly chilly cabin on the street. These three factors (plus the fact we've already paid for a fixed menu) inspire in me a flicker of worry that maybe we've made a very expensive mistake.<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Honey Badger</span><span class="list__item">A woman wearing a baggy pink sweater and jeans sets down a small plate on which lays a flower, a bit of cheese shaped like an acorn and something that looks like an elongated unripe cherry. She recommends we begin with the flower. It starts flat and earthy. In a few seconds my tongue is tingly; reminiscent of a Szechuan peppercorn. The sensation builds. Soon my entire mouth is vibrating. It is intense, though not painful like spicy food. Pop Rocks is a clumsy travesty. Tongue, roof, and cheeks abuzz. Every cell oscillating. Moth agape. Eyes wide. Baffled. Salivating profusely. Our server sets down a deep-pink foamy coupe of hibiscus with Appalachian herbs. It cools and brightens the earthy hum in a way which communicates these people are masters of an unknown craft and that we are in for a wild fucking ride. Next we have the vegan acorn cheese, which is like a funky chunky smoked Gouda. Last is Imagined Fruit made from cashew. It's nutty and lightly sweet, slightly sour. The texture is creamy like marzipan.</span><span class="list__item">Savory custard of wild duck egg yolk with caviar and toasted hay, served in an eggshell in a nest on a branch. I squish the tiny eggs against my teeth for a salty, custardy mouth bath.</span><span class="list__item">Fermented apricot aperitif. Bold, sweet, strong, smooth. It's unclear if this is alcoholic.</span><span class="list__item">Toast of wild grain with diced deer heart and winter truffle. On the plate is a candle made from deer fat.

Umami umami umami.</span><span class="list__item">Koji butternut squash tart with kabocha squash cubes, acorn squash ribbons, water smoked buffalo cream, shaved salted bison and pinecone pollen. Someone mentions a loaded potato skin.</span><span class="list__item">Sweet milk bread with slipper snails, black trumpet and bottarga. Escargot-esque. Our goal is cargo transport from plate to mouth, but these slippery boys can dance. The bread has a hint of toasted marshmallow.</span><span class="list__item">Crab meat with seaweed foam, red pinecone glaze and seaweed powder in a macaron type of sandwich. Cori notes a nod to crab wonton.</span><span class="list__item">Perilla with beach rose petals. It's sweet, syrupy and nutty.

Mineraly and straightforward; a bit like an Adelaide Shiraz.</span><span class="list__item">Fried half quail with seedy grains, heart & liver mousse and blackberry. The animal's leg, feathered wing, and head are in tact on my plate. Liz has its other half (sans head). The presentation of mousse and compote not so subtly resembles a burst abdomen.

Throughout and after the meal we spend time chatting with Fiola, who owns the restaurant with her husband. She tells us about growing up in Kosovo during the war, making pasta during the pandemic for the many elderly residents of her neighborhood, her journey through veganism to foraging, her daughter who designed the cabins and counter, and making the 600 tiles which adorn the restaurant. She is charming and has a magical presence. We happy. It's after midnight and Cori gets us a car home.<br><br>Sean makes different coffee recipe with the same beans. It's very good and quite different from yesterday's cup. Downtown. No luck at Clinton St Baking Co. Hanoi House has an hour wait so we put out names on the list. We stop by Electric Burrito and the four of us share a California. Just as we get to La Cabra Hanoi House texts to let us know our table is ready. We run over, sit down and order meringuey egg coffee, spicy fishy garlic cauliflower, filet mignon pho with crispy bread sticks, bánh mì and shaking beef, which gooey tender and crispy steak cubes that remind me a bit of the General Tso's Chicken from last night. Liz has a mind to pop into Astor Place with hopes of finding a skin-contact wine Ryan recently recommended, The Marigny. We pick up three bottles of that plus some orange wines and a Barbera. A bit further on we stop by Goods for the Study and pick up some very lovely stationery. Our last stop before heading back to the apartment is Whole Foods for ice cream. At the house we relax for the evening with pizza delivery, orange wine, Dandelion brownies, Malai & Jeni's ice cream and lots of good conversation. We share three good things and head off to sleep.	40.851685, -73.941447	Feb 17, 2022	Feb 21, 2022	Sean & Cori																https://photos.app.goo.gl/UkJwXj1KDJHUNdEm6
Los Angeles	Dita Von Bagels	270	x	We land, pick up Belle's Bagels and check into the Westin in Downtown LA. We're in a 30th floor suite and it is sweet. We're feeling a little ill from our driver's noxious steering so we relax for a few before opening up the bagel bag. First is Loxsmith: Michele Cordon Bleu Lox, crispy salmon skin, radishes, dill, pickled fennel and beet cc. Next is a scallion latka followed by Westlake: RC pastrami, swiss, slaw, 1000 island. Holy hell these are good bagels. The Loxsmith rivals Courage, which I thought was untouchable. A bit more lie down. And more. I'm the evening we head through Skid Row to the Arts District Brewing Co. We arrive, but they are having a private event party for Bengals fans. Liz discovers there is a Death & Co about two minutes away though so we walk over and nab a couple of cocktails. Dr Jones has carrot eau de vie and, macadamia nut and a killer texture. Clampdown is a yummy spicy banana daiquiri. We catch a ride to Venice for dinner at Felix Trattoria. They bring a nice rum & nutmeg drink on the house. Shrimp with pesto. A loaf of focaccia. Raddicio salad with anchovy dressing and bread crumbs. Ricotta stuffed fried squash blossom. A nice classy of white wine with notes of wax and green almond skins. Orcchiette with sausage, broccoli greens, peperoncino, tomato and canestrato. Linguine al limone with peperoncino and pecorino. We get a ride to Spare Lane at the Roosevelt Hotel. They let us in, but the place is packed and has more of a club vibe, so we opt to call it a night.<br><br>I rub Liz's legs on the couch as we play Wordle, talk food and watch the sun climb in the sky. Downstairs for a hotel breakfast and then to the pool for a dip. We head to Courage. Our server is super nice. A man sitting behind us is really bugging me so we switch tables and are then better able to enjoy these absolutely insane bagels. We get the garden veggie again and also the ikura bagel, which is just incredible. That nice server I mentioned hooks us up with 15 freebie bagels. Next we head to The Broad, a modern art museum. The highlights are a Kusama Infinity Room and the robust Lichtenstein collection. From there we walk down the hill to the Los Angeles Central Library, whose Free Mason-esque architecture caught our eye yesterday. The central tower is pretty and there's an exhibition on a traveling marionette group from the '20s. Back for a bit of a nap and then out to Major Domo for good wine, fried cauliflower with fish sauce, charred cabbage with XO, a yummy wagyu steak, and a Paris-Brest with banana. Major Domo. Pacific Seas is closed so we walk back to the hotel and watch Titane.<br><br>We work from the hotel. Lunch is Konbi for eggplant katsu sandwich, egg salad sandwich, yuba salad, snap pea salad, kinako latte, banana soda, nori croissant, and a puffed buckwheat flan. I get off, hop on a scooter over to COS, buy some nice clothes, head back and check out of the room. We get a ride to a very depressing Skid Row over to Art District Brewing Company where we wear red (taken) stickers, have some good beers & nachos, watch 10 Things I Hate About You, take a silly photo booth strip, and play a bunch of free skeeball. Next we go to Sonoratown for a chew-stoppingly good steak burrito plus a very nice b&c burrito and chorizo taco. We then walk to the Orpheum Theater for the reason we came to LA. The show is incredible and everyone, including the crowd, looks amazing. Dita starts with the birdcage routine (that ends in a very sexy shower). The host makes a lot of gay jokes. Dirty Martini is a hoot. Zoro is good. Valentina is pretty. One guy dances inside a heart. One woman does an incredible ballet routine. Just after her another woman does mindblowing dancing inside of a large metal hoop. Dita does a very good red shopping Valentine's esque number. A very fit and acrobatic man does amazing things on a metal pole. Dita dances with a star. Though there are still a good number of acts left, we have to leave early to make sure we don't miss our flight back. Our driver is good (rare here) and very fast!	34.042760, -118.255420	Feb 12, 2022	Feb 14, 2022																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/xfY8SvJhZpWC8QAk8
Austin	Tiki Tatsuya	269	x	Veracruz for tacos, including an especially good bean, mushroom and potato baby. HEB for some yummy smelling candles. Round Rock Donuts for a bunch of those. Justin's for some hang, Oculus, and relax. Then we head downtown for Tiki Tatsuya. We start with a big alien punch bowl, complete with a light show and dry ice. Taro tots, Spam in the half shell and a pupu platter. Another round of drinks: Navy Grog, Mai Tai, Pearl Diver, Painkiller. Next to ABGB for beers and a fun live set by Ladyfang.<br><br>Donuts and coffee. Nixon and I play a Can Can duet on guitar and cello. To Anthem for a great Hawaiian burger plus queso with 5 spice brisket and shishito. Next we head to the Blanton Art Museum for good American contemporary art and pretty stained glass. We meet Adriane at Batch to catch up over coffee. It was meant to be a quick stop before hitting the road again, but the weather is gorgeous and we're enjoying the chat with her so much that we stay for nearly two hours. We hit the road. Stop by David's for a curry and an episode of Ozark before heading home. Liz gets the worst migraine she's ever had and is in tears over the pain and nausea. I take her to the ER where they give her medicine and fluids and she feels much better.	30.253771, -97.763304	Feb 5, 2022	Feb 6, 2022	The Plunketts, Adriane																https://photos.app.goo.gl/sdXwmGskw8UHizwLA
Nashville	Meet & Meat	268	x	I start No Time to Die on the flight. Heather picks us up and drives us to her place where we give Frodo butt pats, drink yummy N/A wine from Acid League and chat until 2.<br><br>Her oven is broken so she microwaves water to make us Chemex. Our first stop is Proper Bagels in Belmont for coffee & bagel sandwiches. Its quite cold outside and we have to wait a while since they stopped making eggs for a bit. In time we get some yummy food including a lox bagel, a sausage egg & cheese, and a ham egg & cheese with hash brown. We make for a movie theater as we have tickets for The Tragedy of Macbeth. Hot darn it's something else. I've never seen a movie that looks like this. The surreal sets give me Fritz Lang vibes. The world feels massive and claustrophobic at the same time. The witch, Stephen Root, and the leads are very on point. We stop by the liquor store and then head to Third Man Records, a record store selling only releases from the eponymous label, which is owned by Jack White. I pick up a live blues record plus some 45s. There is a booth from the 40s which allows you to record a 150 second clip directly onto a 7" disc. The three of us cram in and have a nice little chat. Back to the house for negronis and a happy Frodo. Before long we head out to Chauhan for artichoke pakora, whipped paneer, goan mussels, naan, red snapper moilee curry and a lamb lollipop korma. Back home for records, a negroni and boulevardiers.<br><br>Coffee at home before we head to Barista Parlor. They don't have donuts today, but we get a weird CBD cold brew. Our fall back is to head to Joyland for a fried chicken biscuit with honey hot sauce, a sausage biscuit sandwich, fries, a chocolate malt shake, and a fucking incredible burger. None of us seem to mind not having donuts. Heather drives us north to the antique district. At the first shop we focus on vinyl. I find Adam Ant and Heather some thick Bootsy Collins. In the next ship Liz picks out a Christmas ornament from the USSR. It's a peasant figure, which was a common theme at the time along with airships. We've now not eaten for a few hours, which it means we get to eat again. Heather takes us to Chopper, a robot tiki bar with a taco truck parked out front. We start with the stupidest quesabirria tacos with consomme. I can't even wrap my head around how intense the flavor is. The consomme must just be pure jello at room temp. One taco is plenty to hold me over. From the bar we get a couple rounds of nice tiki drinks. The highlights are the clarified milk punch, the frozen Painkiller, and something with Yellow Chartreuse, akavit and gin. Liz buys a mug of the devil with a roller coaster running into his mouth. Back to the house for Bootsy, bulges and bubbles. Liz and I decide to catalog Heather's record collection. Before long we get pretty. A boxer drives us to<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Continental</span><span class="list__item">Oyster continental with sturgeon roe and finger lime</span><span class="list__item">Citrus, chicory and truffle salad</span><span class="list__item">Local cheese gougere</span><span class="list__item">Salad with alligator pear, herbs, and buttermilk</span><span class="list__item">Venison, pork liver, veal tongue, pistachio and black currant pate en croute</span><span class="list__item">Golden tilefish with potato scales, beluga lentils, brown butter, ras el hanout</span><span class="list__item">Berkshire lardon-threaded pork medallions, sunchoke with barding, liver pate</span><span class="list__item">Thick prime rib</span><span class="list__item">Squash with black walnut praline and preserved lemon</span><span class="list__item">Black pepper & honey rolls</span><span class="list__item">Vanilla custard with lemon curd, pomelo and grapefruit</span><span class="list__item">Rice pudding on papadam</span><span class="list__item">Banana maple sherbet with chocolate ganache</span><span class="list__item">A bunch of good wine</span><span class="list__item">Braulio, which is like a nuttier and less intense Fernet</span></span>The staff are lovely, the meal is delightful and the company is top knotch.

Montreal	Part Deux: The Fattening	267	x	We wake at 3 a.m. and head to the airport. Our first leg lands us at O'Hare, where we spend the day working and eating the free food in the Admirals Club. Ryan shows up at around 3 and warns us of the danger that lies ahead. He informs us that he offended chef Michael at PDC last time he was there by calling the food mediocre and that he is now on a mission to destroy all our bodies. We catch our second leg to Montreal. We get a car to the hotel and clean up for just a few before heading to Milky Way for a few rounds of cocktails and shots of Canadian Club. It's very late and we're all feeling peckish so we stop for McDonald's before heading to bed.<br><br>We take our time getting up before hopping on the train to Beauties. We're short on time before our lunch reservation, so we just grab a lox bagel sandwich and eat it on the street. There is a heap of sliced onion, big juicy tomatoes, capers, smear, and salmon on a slightly crunchy, chewy sesame bagel. A great start (not counting McDonald's) to our food tour. We catch a car to<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">McKiernan</span><span class="list__item">A warehouse restaurant in an industrial part of town, which specializes in roast chicken</span><span class="list__item">Macerated wine</span><span class="list__item">Albacore croquettes with beurre blanc</span><span class="list__item">Brussels Sprouts with bleu cheese</span><span class="list__item">Prime rib donut sandwich</span><span class="list__item">Charcuterie ragu</span><span class="list__item">Maple glaze donut and apple pie cheesecake filled donut</span></span>We walk a lot, check out the local herbs, and explore the beautiful city. After a couple of hrs make our way to Vin Papillon for a bunch of very nice wine plus anchovie & butter on house focaccia; tuna crudo with orange & herbs; ham, hard cheese & brown butter; butternut squash donuts brushed with honey and dipped in fondue. From there we try for Atwater, but the line is long so we head to PDC for a shot of Calvados plus maple G&Ts.

Ryan warns us that this is actually the lighter food day...<br><br>I don't remember going home. I think we were very drunk. We sort out doing our COVID tests via video chat. At around 12 we make our way to Arthur's Nosh Bar. We put our name on the list and walk across the street to Campanelli for coffee and pan au chocolat. A cute little dog comes up to our table to say hi. At Arthur's we share pancakes, beef bacon, spicy fried chicken with maple syrup, latkas, challah, a chicken schnitzel sandwich, and a Caesar (Bloody Mary) topped with a mini lox bagel sandwich. It snowed beautifully while we were eating and now the streets are quiet and covered in white. We stop by a market to pick up some wine and head back to the hotel for a bit to nap. A few hours later we are up and head out for the Cloakroom, but they are full so we head to The Coldroom for some okay cocktails.

Hawaii	New Island	266	x	We get upgraded to first class. I eat a spicy shrimp dish, finish The Sparks Brothers, and play a lot of Breath of the Wild. We land, get a Soul, and head tj the condo to meet the gang; Anne, Richard, Gene, and Tina. They have been here for a while on holiday. When we were planning out trip out we decided to stay here with them. We start the good times off with a yummy coconut rum and passion fruit libation. There's still a few hours before dinner, so we head out to a nearby beach which is known to have good coral. We get suited up and jump in. We immediately see loads of fish of all sorts of colors and beautiful coral formations, which house both black and red pencil sea urchin. We only do about 20 or so minutes in the water before getting out to dry off and head back. Back at the condo everyone showers and celebrates with another drink before making out way to Papa Kona, an American food restaurant in Downtown Kona which features a live 2-piece music set. They do top 40 covers and the woman has a nice voice. Though the food is unremarkable the company is lovely. I am surprised at how westernized everything is here. I don't know that I saw a single native Hawaiian person all day. It feels more like visiting a tropical version of Southern California than a Polynesian island. It's about 3am Dallas time when we get home from dinner so we all head pretty much straight to bed.<br><br>I wake up at 5 and play some Zelda for a bit. Once everyone is up we all sit out on the patio and have coffee with the Kirkland version of Bailey's. The condo overlooks a forested area which sounds and looks like it's teeming with wildlife. I see quite a few birds, which I can identify as birds. A mongoose runs into the forest. Gene tells me that mongooses we're brought to the island to eat the rats, which were feeding on the sugarcane. Unfortunately, they didn't help much with the rats, but did significantly hurt local bird populations. We all pack up for s day at the beach. Tina makes us wraps with chicken, cucumber, and Branson Pickle. We drive north for about 50 minutes through a black lava lunar landscape before arriving at this isolated oasis of green, which they call 'A Beach'. I pretty quickly hop in the water with a snorkel mask and explore the reef. The water is quite choppy and murky today, but I am able to still see a good variety of colorful babes. Before long I find myself next to a sea turtle whose shell is roughly the size of a Thanksgiving turkey serving dish. We both float casually and inspect one another for a couple of minutes before parting on good terms. A little further on I find a bright orange bit of live Coral which houses a large family of black and white clown fish. As I swim up they quickly hide away in the brain-like structure, but soon make their way cautiously back out to resume their business of whatever it was they were doing before. I get out, head back, and swap the snorkel for the inflatable paddle board. I do a quick test run and see a group of turtles from above. Because the wind is so strong I can really only paddle in one direction. I land and decide to go further out this time and with Liz. I paddle her around like a gondolier and it is very nice. After some hammock relaxing we pack up and start to head back. As we're walking back to the parking lot Tina points out a cat sanctuary in a large tree/cave area. We see quite a few cats and make friends. Back to the condo for a quick clean up (and cocktail) before walking to Don the Beachcomber, a very pretty tiki-esque hotel bar. Drinks are Mai Tais and Lava Flows. For food we all share plates of coconut shrimp, poke nachos, regular nachos, buffalo fries, pork tacos, and calamari. It's is all very yummy and we are treated with a pretty nice sunset too. Back and immediately to bed.<br><br>More Bailey's coffee. Tina makes us banana pancakes. We don't have plans for today, but Tina convinces us to make the trek to the Volcano park. It's a lot of driving and not much extra time so we head out pretty quickly. We first make for the southern most point of the US. There's a fair crowd out there. The cliffs are quite pretty and the water is crystal clear. There are a few wooden platforms overlooking the water. These are used for cliff diving. About 20 meters back from the cliff is a hole in the ground leading to a beautiful, rough water chamber. We drive on s bit to visit the southern most bakery in the US. We get a chocolate custard doughnut and a lily koi doughnut. They are both very good with a firm crust and chewy dough. Onward to the volcano park. We first do a point on the north rim of the caldera, which has some pretty views of bright yellow sulfur vents. We drive east and south, then take a mile hike to another viewing platform. From here we can see lava spewing up from a pit in the ground. It is pretty awesome to see. We find out our flight will be delayed a few hours. Just a minute up the road we stop by the lava tube, which is essentially a 1/4 mile-long underground tube. It's pretty cool, but the real treat is the rain forest hike to it. We pick up some Maui onion chips and water from a general store and hit the road back to Kona. This time we take the saddle road that cuts across the center of the island. About two hours later we are at Umeke, a seafood restaurant which specializes in poke. We get Hawaiian oysters Rockefeller, poke with rice & kimchi cucumber, and poke nachos, which are even better than last night's nachos. It is very good and very filling. We make back to the condo where we get to sneak in a few games of sequence before taking ourselves plus Anne and Richard to the airport. We sleep the whole flight then go straight to work.	19.625436 -155.984434	Nov 5, 2021	Nov 8, 2021	Anne, Richard, Gene, Tina			19.914197 -155.887339	19.625436 -155.984434	18.910416 -155.680801	19.401776 -155.265570										https://photos.app.goo.gl/879D3ydwkV76nuBCA
Napa	Jessica Wedding	265		I didn't take notes for this trip, but on Friday we saw Slow Gherkin in San Francisco, on Saturday we attended Jessica & Drew's wedding in Napa, and on Sunday we ate at French Laundry.	38.404403 -122.364979	Aug 24, 2018	Aug 26, 2018	Jessica, Drew, Millers	San Francisco, Napa															
San Francisco	Jessica Wedding	264	x	To the fancy hotel where we brush our teeth. Shoes and socks for Liz, SIM for me. Philz for coffee and kouing amon. We meet Melvin and head to Pagan Idol for a Tropical Bird, a Thai Tea, Tucan Dance. To Lolo for chips, salsa, guac, shrimp tacos, mushroom & cheese fondue, and cricket guac tostadas. I fall asleep in the Uber. Next is Smugglers Cove for Lei Lani Nouveau, Pampatino, the Don's Own Grog.<br><br>We take a bus to meet Melvin at Nopa for brunch. Cultured butter scone, eggs in a hole, eggs in a kombu broth, soft scrambled eggs and a French press. Liz notices one of the servers has a Luca Font tattoo and we compliment him on it. We walk around Alamo Square Park and admire the Painted Ladies. To Melvin's place where we meet his friend Sarah. We get a ride to the exploratorium on the water, but it is over-priced so we opt to walk along the wharf and go to the Musee Mechanique where we play Foosball, take a photo booth strip, and play pinball. To Souvla, a Greek place in the Mission, for a lamb kebab, garlic fries, and a frozen yogurt that is way too salty. We take the train to San Jose to see David Byrne in concert. It's his American Utopia tour and one of the coolest concerts I've ever heard or seen.<br><br>Coffee and bagel. To Zante's, but they are closed. Liz gets her nose pierced from a nice Perry. ABV Pink Flamingo, Tarragon Fix; fried cauliflower, fried soft-shell crab, peach & tomato toast with goat cheese, lamb meatballs with peach, foie gras olives, smoked trout mouse and nectarine cracker.	37.329874 -121.892232	Aug 17, 2018	Aug 19, 2018	Melvin	San Francisco, San Jose															
Palm Springs	Newlyweds	263	x	Justin picks us up and we head straight to Mom's for a hang out with them and the kids. After a bit of that, we head to the condo to get looking fresh and then head to PS. We try to get into Bootleggers, but even at 3:30 they are already packed so we head to Tonga Hut. It is quite charming and the drinks are all very good. Straight to the reception from there where we catch up with Uncle Michael and Nancy, Justin, Jake, and about 150 of Mom & Jim's closest friends. After some chicken dinner and getting to hear Justin's rendition of She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy we mingle the night away.<br><br>I wake up quite early to drop Justin and the family at the airport. Coffee and a sandwich and then back to Liz. At around 10 we head to Mom's where we hang with them plus Michael and Nancy for a few hours. Mom bought us tickets to a special tour of the Frey House II, so we head out for that. It's a small, minimalist, yet absolutely beautiful home of the architect Albert Frey. I knew nothing of him coming in, but learn that he had an incredible talent for designing very iconic buildings which were very pragmatic and fitted to their environment. After about 40 minutes of exploring the 800 sq foot home nestled just up the mountain and learning loads about the fascinating man from some very informative docents, we head back down to the Palm Springs Art Museum. Free entry was included with our tour so we take in the modest, yet very charming space. We are especially enthralled by the native landscape works and by the glass exhibition. We head down the street to the Architecture wing of the museum, which is featuring an exhibition chair design. There are some real beauties. Next stop is Bootlegger, where our bartender makes us some delicious concoctions as well as offering fun conversation. It's getting late so we start to head back, but not before grabbing some Del Taco, which hits the spot.<br><br>We work most of the day from the kitchen. In the evening Jim & Mom take us to Big Rock, sort of a one-off Hard Rock with some better food. We meet Justin, Michelle, and their four kids, who are a hoot. Wyatt, Michelle's son is whip-smart and on his way to becoming a Young Sheldon. We part ways and head back to the house where we stay up late sitting around the fire, drinking Italicus spritzes, and hearing the origin story of Mom & Jim.	33.823166 -116.553264	Oct 16, 2021	Oct 19, 2021	Michelle, Jim, JD & Fam, Uncle Michael & Nancy, Indio folks	Palm Springs, Indio															https://photos.app.goo.gl/ep2eFeGob2z9emyj9
Playa Paraiso	Grevelyn	262	x	We catch a shuttle to the hotel. Our driver gives us the scoop on some good local foods to try, like rajas poblanos, sauteed poblanos with onions and crema. We get in and meet Greg, Andrew, and Veritay. Our room isn't ready yet so we wander the grounds for a bit. After walking right by a peacock we spot a cute little mix between a cat and a racoon, which is called a Coati. Within minutes we see many more. We stop into the lunch buffet for some yummy Mexican including rajas poblanas, which is really good. We check into the room and cool down for a bit. At around 7 we get dressed for the white party and head out. We immediately bump into Evelyn and Greg and find that the plans have changed. We walk instead to dinner where we dine on Mediterranean with the Three C's, Caitlyn, Christina, and Carrie. From there we all migrate to the lounge bar, where we mingle with April, Rose, Angela, Adrianne, Jason, Haxter. After some snacks from the cafe we head to bed.<br><br>Liz isn't feeling 100% so I head out on my own for a bit. I immediately bump into Rose and we chat for a few. Though the resort is a good size, it seems that every time I walk out the door I bump into someone I know. I head a few minutes south to the beach. As I pass over the mangrove boardwalk I see dozens of coati running around. Many of them are quite young and they all are adorable. I get a drink and a chair before settling in for a bit. After some light reading I hop in the warm blue-green water and play with the waves. I chat with the Three C's for a bit and also catch up with April and Angela. The three of us meet Liz for lunch at the same buffet as yesterday. From there, Liz and I check out the beach and the secret pool for a bit before heading back to the room to get cleaned up for the wedding. Once we're looking spiffy we head back to the beach for the ceremony. The weather is perfect and the sun is low in the sky. It is a very beautiful ceremony. Just as they are able to walk back down the isle as husband and wife I hear a live mariachi band strike up just behind me. Next thing I know the air is filled with bubbles. It is a wonderland. We all drink bubbles and take photos on the beach in the sunset light. When the sun goes down we migrate to the convention center for the reception. Drinks, dinner, dancing, photo booth. We sit with Andrew, Veritay, Adrianne, Jason, and Franz. Jason gives us a homemade treat for later. Evelyn straps a GoPro to a bottle of tequila, stands up on a chair, and pours it into the mouths of many of the guests. We dance so good. I haven't danced this much or this hard in years and it feels so good. Back to the lounge bar for more drinks and good times. They head to the beach, but I'm wiped and call it.<br><br>First we head to the convention center to get our covid tests. To the breakfast buffet where we munch on chiliques, tacos, and more goodies. From there we book a tour of Tulum which includes visits to archeological sites and a visit to a cenote (sinkhole pool). We catch up with Adrianne and Jason for a bit longer and head back to the room. We snack on some treats and watch Night of the Teese, a burlesque spectacle. Over to the beach we find some nice chairs and fall in love with the fractal clouds. My filters are off. I'm feeling the breeze, the birds, the water, the sounds, my gums, my stomach, my eyelids. When I'm ready I wade into the choppy water and dance ballet with the waves. Three C's let us know that the slides will be closing soon so we head over there to have a few more wild rides. A good bit of the wedding crew is there and are cheering people on as they scream and shout their way down the chutes. Once last call is over we head to the pool bar. Evelyn hands us a GoPro and asks us to film ourselves jumping into the pool. I hold the camera while Liz and I jump in together. Immediately after she gently informs me that she just ripped off her big toe nail. She doesn't want to cause a scene and ruin the good vibes so we quietly get out and sit her down. It's pretty rough looking and apparent that she needs medical attention. I ask the staff for some assistance. Before long we are at the on-site medical clinic with a nurse. She is telling us that the nail needs to come off, but that she doesn't have the tools to do it. She recommends getting a taxi to Playa del Carmen and finding a clinic to do it. Liz wants to just wait until we are back in the US to have the procedure done, which is two days from now. The nurse implies that is not a good idea. After a bit of discussion we decide to cut our trip early and fly back first thing tomorrow morning to get it cared for. The nurse bandages her up and doesn't charge us, which is incredibly kind of her. We head back to the room for a bit to process everything that just happened. After sorting some logistics for a bit we decide to head to the Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. We weren't able to get reservations, but we thought we'd just try our luck. We get a ride over to the resort, which is two over from ours, but within the same complex. This is clearly the posh hotel and it is stunning. It's a massive covered tile lobby with a large sun-tiled dome. There are massive cast clam shells (Venus De Milo esque) with humongous cuttlefish serving as the columns. Further on the smooth tiled floors drop straight into a shallow, tropical looking pool. It's dark out, but there is some subtle lighting. As we approach the pool, we find a black swan standing on an island about ten meters from us. Another few dozen meters past her we spot a flamboyance of flamingos. It is as majestic as it sounds. We walk onward to the restaurant. Our luck holds out and, within a few minutes, we are sat at a table drinking red wine and eating buttery garlic bread. Before long the servers are bringing by skewers of crispy chicken thighs, juicy tenderloin, seasoned sausages, spare ribs, and cinnamon-rubbed pineapple. It is a feast and doesn't take long for us to tap out. Back to the hotel we pack for a few and then head to the lobby bar for some reconnecting, meeting new folks like Natalie and Frank, karaoke (I sing Tenderness), and final goodbyes.<br><br>We get just a few hours sleep before an early trip to the airport. 	20.756107 -86.958137	Oct 1, 2021	Oct 4, 2021	Evelyn, Greg, Rose, Angela, April, Adrianne, Jason, Andrew, Veritay, Caitlyn, Christine, Carrie, Natalie																https://photos.app.goo.gl/wBJuq5y7o1SW6v2v8
Naples	Just for Fun	261	x	We take a long and windy mountain road to Naples. Liz booked us a funky hotel in a funky part of town. Driving and parking is pretty stressful. I manage to navigate some incredibly tight alleys. She's not feeling well from the heat so I head out solo for a while to take in the city. This city makes me think of Berlin in the 90s or probably Portland now. It's dirty and poor and totally alive. I eat unknown fried food on the cobblestone and and buy a Aperol spritz from a man selling alcohol from a table in front of an unmarked door. It seemed to be pretty normal. I watch an old woman let her dog take a big shit in the middle of a busy pedestrian area and walk away. Liz still isn't feeling well so I grab a margherita pizza with some fried foods to go from Matteo, a beer from the street guy, plus a cannoli and head back to the room to eat some very yummy food.<br><br>The ac control doesn't work so the machine pumps out very chilly air until I cut the power and then a few hours later get hot an turn it back on. We get up late. Downstairs at a cafe, a man with "I fucking hate you" tattooed on his thigh asks for the time. We pass by a shop of curiosities. It is closed, but we are entranced by the window display featuring many busts of a blindfolded Lady Fortune, statues of the Devil, and bronze penises. To Matteo for a fritta, which is basically a deep fried pizza with crust on both sides. It is messy and delicious. The cool looking church is already booked for the day so we head north to Piazza Bellini where a man pulls up on a bicycle with a PA attached playing The Boss, by The Braxtons. This city is covered in graffiti and street art. Next up to Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Nipoli, where we are a bit let down to find the Gabinetto Segreto (secret cabinet), full of ancient erotic art from Pompei, has already closed for the day. We do take in some lovely mosaics that are old enough to make the Rembrandt seem like a contemporary of Ai Wei Wei. Up to the second floor, the main hall is featuring an extensive exhibit about gladiators, covering everything from the arena architecture, to the warriors clothing and diet, to the different weaponry and fighting styles, to the politics of funding an event. It is very educational and interesting. Next is a massive model and rooms of artifacts from Pompei. Frescoes from there and then we're feeling pretty done. The museum is not air conditioned and by the end Liz is starting to feel unwell. We walk back to the hotel and Liz lies down for a few hours to recuperate. At around 10:30 we head out. Sorbillo still has a long line out front so we opt for something less conspicuous. We get a Diavolo and a Romana pizza. They are both unmemorable. To bed.<br><br>Up early and we hit the road to Pompei. Everything goes smoothly and before long we're ready for our tour with Guillermo and a kind Italian couple. He is incredibly informative on both Italian history and metal music. He teaches is an Italian sign for casting out bad spirits, which Ronnie James Dio learned from his grandmother, started using at concerts and became the standard metal "sign of the Devil". Guillermo tells us that in 79 ad the volcano shot 200,000 tons of ash and debris per second for about two days. The cloud of junk shot 40km into the sky and, becuase of the direciton of the wind, landed right on top of Pompei and the surrounding area. Considering the city had a volcano explode onto it and was covered in fifteen meters of debris and ash for nearly two millennium it's in remarkable condition. Many of the frescoes within people's homes are still clearly visible. The city is vast and would take days to really explore, but he takes us on a greatest hits tour of some well-preserved amphitheaters, streets, homes, shops, brothels, temples, casted bodies, political signs, mosaics, frescoes, phallic objects, baths, pots, fountains, architectural features, and the acropolis. The word used for brothel here is 'lupanare', which essentailly translates to 'wolf den'. He suggests is was called that because the prostitutes would howl on the stree corners to attract attention. We have a great time and learn a lot. On top of that, the weather was fairly cool and the crowd was pretty quiet today. We purchase a flying penis ornament and head to the parking lot, which has a restaurant attached and offered a discount for us eating there. My initial expectations weren't high, but holy hell it was good. We started with a charcuterie board of mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, ricotta, salami, prosciutto, and lardo. Liz very accurately described the mozzarella being cut as "weeping milk". The main was a damn fine calzone stuffed with ham, ricotta, and mozzarella, and mushrooms. Pompei was so great that we decide to also visit Ercolano, a smaller coastal town west of Visuvus which was better preserved than Pompei due to it receiving mainly ash deposit. It is so well preserved and reconstructed that it doesn't even feel real. The scale of time that were seeing is so much further than any habitable structures we've seen in America, the UK, or  Japan. These don't feel like ancient ruins, like Stonehenge, these are relatable. There are kitchens, stoves, baths, shops, gardens, bedrooms, paintings and so much that makes it feel very real and very immediate. I don't have to try very hard to imagine people living and breathing here. I learn that many people ran to the docks on the coast with the hope of surviving. However, the 30 km cloud of heat and ash which the poured down on the town didn't care about the coastline; in fact, it extended the coast out another 1.5 km. The docks we saw were filled with skeletons. There is no way to transition these two things, but next we drive to see the Fendi headquarters building, which is known as the "square coliseum". It sits alone at the top of a hill and is beautiful. Next we drive to Fumicino where after checking into the hotel, we head for dinner at a riverside seafood restaurant. The salmon tartare with raspberries is pretty weird, but the slapping pasta with sea bass and the katsu tuna steak are pretty awesome. I try taking the wine bottle out of its ice pack and accidentally knock my glass off the table doing so. It all happens pretty slowly, but Liz watches the whole thing go down without taking her lips off of her glass. A group of kids next to us is being pretty annoying playing hide-and-seek around our table. We make some understanding gestures with an older woman sitting next to us. Before we know it, she is telling Liz, in French, that she is an ambassador of orphan (often?) children and has a villa in Tunisia. She stops the playing children and forces them to apologize to us. Then, we're not entirely sure, but we think she guilts the restaurant into giving us a free disgestivo for our troubles.	40.851208, 14.257964	Sep 8, 2021	Sep 10, 2021		Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino		40.750239, 14.486884	40.804446, 14.347535	40.851208, 14.257964	41.771630, 12.231103										https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69
Amalfi Coast	Just for Fun	260	x	I start the day with a cappuccino downstairs. Even though we leave 20 minutes early, we still aren't able to make our train on time. Everything here seems to take quite a bit longer than we're used to. We get the car and they "upgrade" (ie they were out of the other cars) us to an automatic, which I am quite relieved to learn. I spend the next three hours cussing out asshole drivers that might actually be worse than Texans. I think the general mentality here is that the larger your vehicle is the more you get to ignore that other cars exist. The first two hours are on larger autostrada and the final hour involves skirting the jagged coastline with vehicles hell-bent on treating the narrow roads like a race track. Once at Atrani, Carlo helps lug the bags up many flights of narrow stairs to our room with an absolutely charming view of the town. We are pretty wiped and nap for a bit. Around 6 we get up. Just as we are about to head out a burst of wind, rain and lightning hit and keep us locked in for a while longer. Fortunately, the view of the storm is spectacular. When the sky slows to a steady trickle we brave the outdoors. Down the stairs and through the mountain passageway and we are dropped right in the middle of Almafi. We stop for a gelato when the rains pick up again. We window shop our way up the charming main street until the shops close. Back down the street and through the tunnel to La Palma where we dine in white wine, mussels, fries, linguine with anchovy garum, and local fish with "crazy sauce". The meal and weather work together to create a lovely evening. We end with a limoncello and head back to the room for some nice times.<br><br>We check out and catch a ferry to Positano, where we will spend the next two hours exploring the touristy, but still quaint town. We buy a nice lemon painted serving dish for my mom's wedding present and dine on a delicious lemon custard tart cup. Back to Amalfi where we pick up a cute lemon ornament, put down a panino, gobble granita, and buy some booze.	40.635940, 14.608523	Sep 7, 2021	Sep 8, 2021		Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino		40.635940, 14.608523	40.634807, 14.602011	40.629530, 14.486382											https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69
Rome	Just for Fun	259	x	We both got COVID tests two days ago, but I still haven't received my results as the plane is boarding. We opt not to risk landing without results so head back home and decide to try again tomorrow.<br><br>This time we have scheduled rapid tests at the airport. We get them and get on the flight. The woman sitting next to me does a sharp sniff about every 5-10 seconds for the entire 10-hour flight. I don't sleep. On the train into town there are miles of blocks of worn-looking apartment buildings; all about 9 stories tall. There's lots of graffiti. Some of it is quite good. One piece features a demon giving us the middle finger. We pass under an aqueduct. Walking out of the metro we see the Spanish Steps to our right. There are many of them and they look very pretty. We arrive at the very charming Hotel Mozart at around 11. Our room is ready so we decide to lie down for just a few minutes...we finally force ourselves out of bed at 3. We hit the pavement and walk down a small but crowded street with many shops. After about 15 minutes walking south we pass by a promising restaurant called Osteria Bacco where we enjoy Aperol spritzes, artichoke (in both the Roman and Jewish styles), fried squash blossom with mozzarella and anchovy, and a beef carpaccio with rosemary and black truffle. Fabio, our server, is an absolute gem and recommends a white dessert wine from Umbria, where he is from. It is less sweet than a Vin Santo and has pleasing notes of mineral and honey. With the wine, he also serves us a special type of almond biscotti called a cantucci, which pairs particularly well with the wine. We walk not even two minutes to Trevi Fountain, which is gorgeous. It feels like Las Vegas. In a few more minutes we stop at a restaurant bar for some espresso. We spend the next two hours meandering our way by the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, the Jewish neighborhood, and a dizzying array of beautiful buildings, streets, corners, shops, and bistros. At around 8 we arrive at Da Enzo to find a line about three times the capacity of the restaurant and decide to head towards Tonnarello, a place one of Liz's colleagues recommended. The wait here is a much more reasonable twenty minutes. We start with a bottle of Chianti and a few cestino, which are essentially Roman arancini. Dinner is cacio e pepe and amatriciana (guanciale, tomato, pecorino). The spaghetti is pleasantly thick and chewy on both. The cacio e pepe is very good, but doesn't quite meet our memory of last time. The amatriciana is cheesy, salty, and incredible. We chat with our neighbor, Phillip from Birmingham (Alabama), for a good bit before taking an exciting cab ride back to the hotel and crashing.<br><br>We were meant to head to Naples today, but car rentals are completely booked, so we opt to spent another day in Rome. We drink a few cappuccinos at the cafe next door while we plan our day. Next we head to a grocery down the street for some pistachio butter, licorice treats, and cantuccini. For lunch we head south, past the Spanish Steps, to Piccolo Buco. The appetizer is two anchovies sitting atop a few curls of butter all on a single piece of toast. It is absolute perfection. Pizza 1 is four cheese with a yellow tomato sauce. Pizza 2 is fried cubed eggplant with local sliced mozzarella on red sauce. This is a unique style of pizza where the crust under the sauce part is almost paper thin and the edge crust is a massive pillow of crispy deliciousness. Back to the hotel again to drop the leftovers off. Liz is feeling a bit tired and decides to take a nap. I rent an electric standing scooter and head towards the Vatican. The streets are very bumpy and it's an exciting ride. I arrive at the city walls only to be told that they are closed for the rest of the day. I loop around the entire country before heading back across the water to the antique shop-heavy neighborhood. We are on the hunt for some sweet mid-century Italian cocktail glasses. No luck at the 8 or so shops visit, but a lovely purveyor tells me the story of Romelus and Remus when she sees me eyeing a statue of two babies suckling the teets of a massive wolf. I wait in the beautiful square for a few minutes until Liz meets me. We walk together south to Trastevere and get in line for Da Enzo. The line is quite long, but we somehow make it in the first seating. To start we order a carafe of the house red with a plate of pre-pulled burrata. It is almost soup-like from all of the cream and the strands of cheese twirl around my fork like fettuccine. We order the same pastas as last night: cacio e pepe and amatriciana. Wow wow wow. Last night was great, but these are both superlative. The cacio e pepe has LOTS of coarse fresh ground pepper on top and throughout which gives a pleasing, almost menthol brightness that cuts through the creaminess of the cheese. For the amatriciana they use a rigatoni pasta, which is a perfect little train car for transporting the thick, cheesy sauce and gives a delightful surprise with each bite. The red sauce is umami-rich and carries notes of sharp cheese and pork fat. The guanciale is cut into little rectangular sheets and seared crispy to house the unearthly flavor. Somehow we convince ourselves that we have room for tiramisu, which I don't regret one bit. The cocoa powder is topped heavily just before serving, the custard has a rich eggy texture, and there's a soft chocolate dollop near the bottom. All that plus a coffee-soaked lady finger on the side makes for the perfect ending. After a long stroll winding our way north through the city streets, we are back at the hotel where we crash for a bit. At midnight we get up to watch Eric Weirheim make orange chicken.	41.835522, 12.465640	Sep 4, 2021	Sep 7, 2021		Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino		41.835522, 12.465640	40.634807, 14.602011												https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69
St Louis	Ranch Life	258	x	We get a ride from the airport to Catalyst for an okay cold brew and some okay art. Our plan is to spend most of the day at City Museum, then eat ranch at Twisted Ranch, and then fly home. While looking at the okay art, Liz sees that our evening flight is cancelled. The next latest flight is at 3pm, so we opt to skip the museum and go straight for the ranch. We do a 13-ranch fry flight, buffalo wings, and a grilled cheese. A few of the ranches are pretty good, but overall the food is nothing memorable. Straight back to the airport where we are, very fortunately, able to catch the one non-cancelled flight of the day back to Dallas.	38.608835, -90.201324	Aug 14, 2021	Aug 14, 2021																	
Paris	Finally	257	x	On the flight I watch Jurassic Park, which is a gem, though Jeff Goldblum's character is a lot sleazier than I remember. After an hour of trains and getting bumped into by folks (personal space seems to be a thing of the past here) we arrive at Moxy Bastille. Our room isn't ready, so we do some quick cleaning up. We are surprised to find a text from Melvin saying he is at the brunch restaurant waiting for us (we mistakenly thought the plan was to meet tomorrow). We rush out and meet them about 20 min later. They had given up on the boat restaurant because the food looked crap. We walk a few minutes instead to a charming tiny place where we sip on nice coffee and catch up. Shortly our Benedict and savory burrata french toast arrives and we chow down on that for a good bit. Alexia tells us of her new passion in wound care. From there, Melvin shows us down a narrow, cafe-lined street which he calls "Vieux Paris". It's sort of a cleaner French version of Piss Alley. Alexia leaves to go visit with her brother. I buy some peacock stationary. Moments later we walk by a specialty shop selling only canned seafood from Belle Isle. Only a few more moments later I get pajamas from Muji. Walking again we see protestors protesting. Melvin then leads us for about 20 minutes to Bon Marche, a classy and beautiful department store & food market. We try on lovely cologne at Le Labo and gawk at the furniture upstairs before exploring the food hall. We sit down at the patisserie and share a Paris Brest, an apple tart, and a Tarte Tropézienne. We part ways. On the train, a woman is either preaching or begging. She pulls out an egg shaker and makes an absolute mockery of what is probably a decent a French tune with her lazy, meandering voice. Back to the hotel. We are both nearly delirious with exhaustion and sleep until the sun is low in the sky. Just before sunset we muster the energy to walk the 400 meters to Chez Janou. David recommended this place based I think solely on the fact that they serve chocolate mousse from a comically large bowl. We didn't necessarily have the highest expectations for anything but the mousse. As it turned out though, the atmosphere, service, wine, mussels, steak, and mousse were all very lovely. We walk back and go straight to sleep.<br><br>Eventually we eat breakfast, shower and head out. Our first stop is Fringe for a to-go cold brew. Onto Ladurée where we pick up macrons for Rob & Tony. We also stay for an orange blossom macron and a St Honour, a mountain of whipped cream atop a mound of vanilla custard and brulee pastry. Liz orders in French. Elle est parfaite. Le Metro. We stop by the newly renovated La Samaritaine to appreciate the ornate iron staircase and partake in the photomaton. A little further on and we're at the Louvre. We descend into the glass pyramid, use the facilities, snack on some Paul, and begin. First stop is the Greek sculpture hall to appreciate Liz's favorite piece: Cupid reviving Psyche. We get a bit lost, but soon make our way up to Mona Lisa. After a nap on a bench we head through the rooms of Louis XIV and Napoleon, filled with hanging tapestries, scarlet wallpaper, golden pocket watches, long dining tables, Egyptian booty, lacquered cabinets, marble penises, and, of course, a dragon's hoard worth of paintings. Paintings depicting wars, revolutions, coronations, monkeys stealing fruit, Greek heroes (including the same scene we saw earlier of Cupid and Psyche), capitalist armadas, Jesus, clothed women, partially clothed women, nude women, angles, daemons, and countless cherubs. Two trains later we are back at the hotel for a deep late-afternoon nap. When the sun is nearly down we get up, noodle around a bit, and hit the pavement. Earlier in the day we walked by our old haunt, Candelaria, and now it is calling our name. On the patio we dine on frozen margaritas, frijoles with chips, and a platter of duck confit mole tacos. We leave nothing behind. Into the back room for a Mango-Bango and a Royal Street. Our server is kind and allows us to choose whether we prefer to speak in French or English. This has actually happened numerous times on this trip already. There seems to be a newly found patience for budding Francophones amongst the Parisians. Back to the room for a bit of fun and packing.<br><br>Up early to head home.	48.860146, 2.336343	Aug 6, 2021	Aug 9, 2021	Melvin, Alexia																https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rph8QcwqR1q26W1H6
Yamadera	Now it's Green	256	x	When we were here before everything was covered in snow and the primary mountain path was closed. Now it is late summer, life is bustling, and there's color everywhere. We spend the day hiking up and then back down a gorgeous mountainside which has dozens of small shrines and shops to distracted tired walkers like ourselves. At one little home shop we find some kappa shaped sake caraffes. We buy both.	38.315025, 140.434370	Aug 4, 2018	Aug 4, 2018																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/gZs68RKxVxrFp7WU6
Enoshima	Finally	255	x	We take the train to the edge of the land and then cross the bridge to the tiny island. The town at the end of the bridge is quaint, yet has a subtle majestic quality. It feels a bit like stepping onto the island of Jurassic Park. We have unmemorable sushi before beginning our loop. It feels like quite a climb. There are tiny shrines, homes, shops, and cats dotted along the whole loop. At the opposite end of the island it a nice lookout about 100 ft over the water. We take a narrow stairway down and discover there is an ancient cave site sitting just above the water line. It's a beautiful space, though a bit touristy with statues of a mythical water dragon who supposedly dwells there. We finish the loop and cross the bridge again. The weather is gorgeous, so we opt to sit on the beach and watch the sun go down. After a little which it gets chilly so we hop back on a train to Tokyo.	35.298287, 139.475396	Jul 26, 2019	Jul 26, 2019																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/M94hxhxanaWhGqXB8

Fort Worth	Staycation	252	x	Race St coffee for a lavender latte and an everything bagel dog. Montgomery St Antique mall for General Public, Paul Simon, and ragtime guitar vinyl. Hot Box Biscuit Club for a chicken gravy sandwich, a chicken ranch sandwich, and a miso corn. To the hotel, which is very country and modern and Texas. We relax in the room for a bit, take some ineffective drops and head down to the pool. Folk are packed tight in the water. After hawk-eyeing the chairs for a while we pounce on one, get s smoky margarita, and take a dip. Room, bubbles, and out to Thompson's basement. Our driver dishes out dirt in Risky's upper-management politics. At the bar we order a Maze Runner and a 6 O'clock Tea. They are pretty good, but not great. We walk six minutes to Reata. Our server is charming and reminds me of Doggett. We order onion rings, breaded red fish with a cilantro jalapeño cream sauce, a ribeye, and a corn husk-steamed bread pudding. It is all very good. Back and straight to bed.<br><br>We do the breakfast buffet, which is okay—good thing we didn't pay for it. We walk for about two minutes in the already blazing heat to the covered mall area, in which a few actors dressed as cowboys and hillbillies are about to busk by bickering in a backwater vernacular. We don't stay long enough to find out, but I suspect it will end in a shootout. The building appears to be the livestock transition pens. It is old and gorgeous and the train tracks run right through the middle of it. Now it is populated exclusively by novelty shops and BBQ restaurants. After peeking down into the wooden maze, we head back to the hotel to check out. Liz wants to check out the Dickies store so we do that before crossing back into the cultural South.	32.733930, -97.369295	Jul 24, 2021	Jul 25, 2021																	
Amsterdam	Cats, Rats, Cookie Surprise	251	x	On the flight we both get the pasta, which we both think seems to taste very meat like. I watch The Farewell and The Father, both of which are great, and then sleep a while. We check into the hotel, which has two cats. Liz has some difficulty changing shirts in the lobby. Bagels at Bagels & Beans. The man sitting next to us is making a lot of mouth sucking sounds and it's grossing me out. We walk to Centraal to catch an hour-long bus ride to Zaanse Schans, a traditional Dutch windmill village complete with windmills, cheese, and goats. We take our time taking it all in and taking pictures. The sky is a pale blue with a few puffy clouds dotted around and there is a hearty breeze breathing life into the big pinwheels. After walking up on side for a while we catch a ferry across the river and walk back down a quaint street. We stop in a pub, but after 10+ minutes without a server approaching us, we give up and leave. A cyclist asks for directions to a town we've never heard of. We catch a bus then metro. A man waiting behind us on the train is making cuckoo whistles–apparently to encourage us to move quicker. First we eat frites with Andalouse, then we wait to buy cookies, and lastly return to the hotel. On the bed where we munch down a delicious dark cocoa cookie. It's crispy on the outside and nearly gooey in the center. There is a ribbon of milk chocolate running through the dough and a big lump of pillowy white chocolate smack in the middle. Then we crash. We wake up hours later and I don't know what day it is. We meet the guys by a leather bar and grab okay Italian. We share a cheese pizza with basil on top and sort of a pasta cabbage roll. Afterwards we sit on a bridge, drink beers, shares stories of our day, and watch the sun very slowly fade away. By 10:30 it's finally dark and we call it an evening. One more quick cone of frites on the way home and then to bed.<br><br>After a short walk in the beautiful morning air we are at Rum Baba where we share a superlative cold brew and oat cortado. We alternate sips with bites of the same chocolate cookies from yesterday. The combination of the cookie with cold brew creates a new taste, which is eerily similar to a margarita pizza. We walk northeast for about 15 minutes and arrive at the Katten Kabinet, a whimsical old building decorated with paintings of cats, statues of cats, and real-life cats. 6 minutes west and we are at our old haunt, Singel 404, for a burrata sandwich and a chicken, goat cheese, and tapenade sandwich. We pick up another six-pack of cookies to take home and then stop back at the hotel for a not so quick nap followed by a good touch. Walk and tram over to Brouwerij 't IJ. I ask for the beer with the ostrich on it, which gives Liz a good chuckle (the ostrich is their logo and on every tap). We get a hapjesplank of sausage and cheese plus a few more beers, all of which are lovely. On the street a family of rats is sharing a loaf of bread. Oosterpark is just a few minutes away, so we head there. First we lie down for a bit by the lake where a couple of coots come to say hello. The sky is golden, a few couples are dancing on a raised stage, two men are practicing kickboxing, and another is playing a kora. After I fail to traverse a set of hanging rings and Liz gets pooped on by a bird we take a tram back to the hotel. We watch a few minutes of The Fall of the House of Usher before heading to meet Michael & David at Tales & Spirits for Milk Punch, Zombies, fried chicken and more. They tell how their train from Germany was delayed because someone had to diffuse a WWII-era bomb near the track.	52.473523, 4.817770	Jul 17, 2021	Jul 18, 2021																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/kVdKGfyj9xm5ZSha7
Las Vegas	Hubs	250	x	Just as we land I get a call from Jeremy. We chat for a good while and he encourages us to have a boy and name him Tristain. We check into the Weston. Liz goes to sleep and I investigate the Flamingo. I realize this isn't even the hotel I had in mind when I shared a vision of hanging in Vegas with Liz, it was the Tropicana. I practice playing poker on a 5¢ machine. It takes me a good while at least to lost my $10.<br><br>After a solid workout and a pretty good hotel breakfast we take the bus to the National Atomic Testing Museum where we learn about early atomic bomb design and the different test sites used in the US. Next to Burg(e)r for truffle fries, a meh black garlic Caesar salad, and a good Hell's Kitchen burger. We check out of the Westin and into Tropicana. Unfortunately the pool is closing so we relax in the room for a bit before taking a very long and very raucous bus ride up to the Sahara where we have reservations for José Andreas' Meat Bazaar. We order Ferran Adria olives, steak tartare, a 16oz chateaubriand, and very buttery potato purée. Liz is wiped and wants to head to bed. I am still alert so I explore Circus Circus, whose filth I adore; Resort World, a bland mall; and Excalibur, which is quite a bit nicer than I expected.<br><br>I walk to Eataly only to discover a ~50 person line with only one barista working. Back to Starbucks for breckie and then to the pool for a bit of sun, a nice swim, surprise ducks, and a magnum Piña Colada. Shower up and then we get a ride to Hell's Kitchen for foie gras, seared scallops, a Beef Wellington, and a sinful sticky toffee pudding. We walk down to Bally's where, after being enticed by some praise-giving french women trying to sell me $300 moisturizer, we play 18 holes of Twilight Zone themed mini golf. While the course design is a bit lackluster the decor is absolutely on point. There are many statues and murals depicting scenes from famous episodes. We follow that up with a few rounds of Twilight Zone pinball. From there we catch a bus to The Golden Tiki, which blows our minds. It might be the most well-designed tiki bar I've ever seen. Our bartender described it as Disneyland on acid, which is not wrong. The door stall handles are brass dicks. We imbibe some very nice drinks plus coconut shrimp and perfect crab wontons. Another bus up to Herbs and Rye for some classic cocktails and a chat with Scotty, a bartender from Phoenix. A kind driver drops us off on Fremont street, which is hopping. I see as many men wearing thongs here as women. We pop quickly into Circa for a few hands of digital Blackjack before walking to Taqueria Casa Del Pastor for al pastor tacos and killer carne asada quesadilla. Though it's nighttime, the asphalt still radiates heat. An oven recently powered off. We eat while power walking to the Neon Museum. Holy cow this place is incredible; truly a treasure trove of bygone signage. Many of the pieces are wonderfully restored and all of them are arranged in such a way to give the sense of being in a dreamy cemetery of letters and limbs. Our guide gives good context for many of the works. We board a bus back to Fremont for more of giving Circa our money and then another bus back to the Tropicana.	36.126057, -115.192238	Jun 26, 2021	Jun 29, 2021		Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas	5	25.780652, -80.128626	39.965684, -75.181051	34.146892, -118.255722	33.397986, -111.480571	36.126057, -115.192238									https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6
Phoenix	Hubs	249	x	Anne & Richard pick us up and take us home where we all spend a good while catching up. Lunch is bread, cheese, pâté, and sav blanc. Afterward we all tuck in for a good nap. A few hours later Phoebe comes over for some more nice hangouts. Anne makes a delicious fried calf liver, rashers, onions, potatoes and gravy. Richard goes to bed and Phoebe drops us off in downtown Gilbert at White Rabbit—a pretty hip and busy speakeasy. We have a couple rounds of fancy drinks including one that tasted like a Terry's chocolate apricot. We also snack on bacon wrapped figs and truffle Gouda mac.<br><br>The four of us head to Robbie's for Tristain's memorial service. Nikki, Dad, and a few others give some nice speeches and Jeremy reads a heartbreaking poem. Afterward we all snack on Macayo's and socialize. I meet Gedi and Suzanne. Chas and I discuss fermenting. Preston teaches me about the gameplay structure of Fortnite. Stetson gives me a firm pat on the back. Liz gest overheated so back at the house we all relax for a bit. Once we're up we squeeze in a short game of Catan where Anne sneaks in a steal literally at the buzzer. Over to Phoebe's for a bit to oogle her plants and cuddle Canon & Crusty. She takes us by In-n-Out before dropping us at the airport for our flight to Vegas. On the plane, before takeoff, a flight attendant asks a man if he's okay because she sees him shaking. He tells her he's okay, but that he's homophobic. She asks if he'll be okay being around flight attendants and he says he will.	33.397986, -111.480571	Jun 25, 2021	Jun 26, 2021		Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas	4	25.780652, -80.128626	39.965684, -75.181051	34.146892, -118.255722	33.397986, -111.480571	36.126057, -115.192238									https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6
Los Angeles	Hubs	248	x	We get a car and 50 minutes later are at Sqirl for a crispy rice salad, ricotta toast, horchoffe, and a baker's latte. To the hotel where we rest ever so quickly before having to leave again. Traffic here moves very slowly and everything seems very far apart. It takes an hour to get to Glendale, even though it's only about 9 miles away as the crow flies. Liz tries on some cute sailor pants. We drive over to Glendale where we wander a mall for a bit to kill time until our dinner reservations at Sushi Sasabune. We both opt for the omakase, which turns out to be an excellent choice. The two tataki are killer as are the 12 nigiri they serve us. Just as we're about to leave a couple walks in. I comment to "She is stunning" to which Liz replies "She's Dita Von Teese"! Liz covers her face and cries tears of joy. We contemplate whether it's appropriate to say hi and after a few minutes decided yes. It is pretty short and sweet. Liz tells her about looking forward to ordering from her new site. Dita recommends a bar. We thank them and part ways. Neither of us can stop smiling for the next hour. We go straight to Bigfoot Lodge, the bar Dita recommended, which she accurately described as a rockabilly dive lodge. After a drink and our emotions settle down we go straight home and to bed.<br><br>I wake up early and work out. Then we drive down Melrose to Courage Bagels for a salmon bagel and a veggie bagel. They are both on "burnt everything" and are very likely the best bagels we've ever eaten in our lives. West again to LACMA for some very good modern & contemporary by Kandinsky, Klee, Picasso, Léger, Pollack, Magritte, Kusama, Yoshitoshi and so many more. The museum is gorgeous and feels great to be in. Churro batter ice cream from the store and then a break at the hotel. After a particularly good touch we head to Santa Monica for some beach times. The shore is steep and the waves are aggressive. We hold hands, share memories, take pictures and get sandy. Next to Blossom Vietnamese for yummy spring rolls, noodle "salad", and sublime broth phó. We are both feeling pretty wiped so we opt to go back to the hotel where we fall straight into a deep sleep.<br><br>Primo Donuts for a great orange glaze cake baby before our flight to Phoenix.	34.146892, -118.255722	Jun 23, 2021	Jun 25, 2021		Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas	3	25.780652, -80.128626	39.965684, -75.181051	34.146892, -118.255722	33.397986, -111.480571	36.126057, -115.192238									https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6
Philadelphia	Hubs	247	x	The hotel receptionist lets us check in waaay early, so that's nice. I try to clean out the hair-clogged sink, but am defeated. We stroll past the gorgeous and massive City Hall before sipping beans at La Colombe. Underground to the train and down to Pat's for a definitely better than Geno's cheese steak. The meat is tender and juicy and the bread feels fresh and not mass-produced. Little Saigon is just north, so we walk through that next—it's pretty run down and not as charming as we'd hoped. A nice driver takes us to the Philadelphia Museum of Art where we spend the next few hours appreciating Duchamps, Picasso, Magritte, Van Gogh, Renoir, Rodin, along with a some older Flemish and Italian Renaissance masters who painted some trippy stuff. After a snack at Whole Foods we ride the bus to Fishtown. Contrary to what Dee Reynolds would have me believe it is surprisingly pleasant. At Pizzeria Beddia we eat beans in olive oil & lemon zest, bread with tomato sauce, and asparagus, shiitake, lemon & dill pizza. Afterward we pick up a few beers, head back to the hotel, and watch Minari.<br><br>We sleep in late, which is lovely. We kiss and celebrate being married for our favorite 8 years. Eventually we walk over to Reading Terminal Market where we pick up a pork roll breakfast sandwich, some Peking duck wraps, and a cannoli. After that I walk the shops, but don't find anything. I come back and work out. We are feeling lazy and hang for a while longer. We have an early reservation for Zahav so at 4 we head out. We sit at the bar and are immediately served all sorts of delicious salads (eggplant, beet, cabbage, carrot, fennel, green beans), hummus, and herb flatbread. We get some lovely drinks and continue to get bombarded with dishes like fried halloumi in honeysuckle syrup, carrot schnitzel, seared bass with tahini, grilled apricot, crispy rice, lamb shoulder in pomegranate sauce, and ice cream biscuit sandwiches. We meet Evelyn and Greg nearby for drinks at Sassafras. After a while there we head for a second round at Charlie Was a Sinner. They are both so lovely. Beers in bed.<br><br>Up at 4:30 to hopefully catch a flight. We make it on and six hours later are in LA.	39.965684, -75.181051	Jun 21, 2021	Jun 23, 2021	Evelyn & Greg	Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas	2	25.780652, -80.128626	39.965684, -75.181051	34.146892, -118.255722	33.397986, -111.480571	36.126057, -115.192238									https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6
Miami	Hubs	246	x	I pee at the airport. Only about half of the urinals are occupied, but when I turn around I find someone waiting behind me for my stall. Leaving the airport, we see a big iguana on the side of road. To Moxy and then to Havana Viejo for mojitos, tostones (stuffed plantains), and mojo marinated pork leg. It is an auspicious beginning. We walk down the main drag near Miami Beach. This place feels like a non-stop party. Liz comments that it's like a beach Vegas where everyone is dressed like it's a pride parade. There are a lot of see-through pants. A lot of them. We bear the heat and walk to Time Out Market for a Rocher and coffee. Liz gets a beach hat from Goorin before we head back to the hotel for a deep sleep. Today is Angie's birthday, so we call her to catch up a bit. To Ceviche 105 for a trio of ceviches, fried corn nuts, and smoked lobster & plantain maki. Our final stop is Broken Shaker—a cocktail bar in a lush jungle environment. The bar has regularly been voted as on of the top 50 cocktail bars in the world. It definitely wasn't.<br><br>We munch down a pecan croissant and a guava cheese danish before hitting the beach. The water is pleasant, aqua-green and shallow with gentle waves. Only a few yards in front of us a man gets fully undressed before taking a dip. He doesn't look cold at all. Back to the mainland where we grab subs from Publix, which are delightful. Thanks Michelle! The art museum is full so we opt to wander Wynwood. This area is dense with local shops and galleries. Every wall has art on it. We get a lovely cold brew from Panther where an elderly Chad has a tantrum when they tell him there is no Splenda. Liz tries on some Ray Bans. We get caught in the rain while walking to grab a tamarindo mojito. Next we catch a ride to Little Havana for fritas—Cuban burgers with chorizo—at El Rey. After dinner we stroll down Calle Ocho and take in the neon set to some damn good live music before heading back. Liz sleeps and I practice drawing her.<br><br>The flight to Philadelphia is early. In the airport bathroom, two different times I see men who are unwilling to use an open urinal. They wait for a full empty urinal spacer to open up before going.

Mexico City	Romaing	245	x	As we are driving down the freeway, I see a man standing in the triangle of pavement where the on-ramp lanes merge into normal lanes. He is playing violin for the traffic. We check into our suite, crash for just a few, and catch a ride to Roma. The taco shop we want is closed. We walk for just a minute and find two nice ladies who make us biztec and campechano tacos, which are amazing. We wander from Roma to the park. A man is playing a type of small, hand-cranked nickelodeon and is having a blast doing it. We stop by a large fountain and gaze at the goddess Diana's incredible butt. We head into the park. Appreciate some clothes statues and then catch a cab to Quintonil. Our reservation is for 3:45. By 6, we are ten courses deep plus a hacienda margarita and a Ramos Gin Fizz. Everything is incredible. We explore a nearby square, visit a Sally store, and then sleep for 15 hours.<br><br>After a mediocre hotel breakfast we head to the anthropological museum. In the park outside the museum there is an exercise class doing Pulp Fiction esque dance moves to Rock around the Clock. A minute further along, we hear live flute and drum. We pass through the trees to see where it's coming from and find four men in elaborate costume hanging upside-down and spinning from a 100 foot pole. They are playing the music. As they spin, their ropes lower slowly towards the ground. It is called Danza de los Voladores, Dance of the Flyers. Next we do the museum, which is massive and stunning. There are a few temple facade reconstructions, which are particularly impressive. After tasty elotes, tlayudas, and horchata on the street we walk through the park for a good while. At one point we hear the same flute and drum music. We look around for another group of swinging men, but I don't see them. After a minute Liz pulls out her phone to realize she had the video of them playing in her pocket. We tire out and get a cab to Baltra, a cocktail bar in Roma. After a clarified horchata punch we walk through a park where a very talented man is doing Beatles covers with an elaborate one-man-band setup on his back. A al pastor vendor on the street grabs our attention and we dine on incredible street tacos. Next is Licoreria Limantour where, when we ask the host how long the wait will be, we are informed that time is relative, but probably around 30 minutes. After longer than that we give up and get a ride to Taqueria Los Cocuyos for tacos with mostly non muscle meats. I'm not sure what we had, but at least one was tripa. They were good though. We walk for about 20 and land in Plaza Garibaldi, which is the center for mariachi music in the city. There are dozens of bands hanging out in full regalia. Many are playing for just one or two people. We take it all in for a while before settling on a nice looking Norteno group, who play us a groovy tune.<br><br>After a workout and a better breakfast we get a ride to Teotihuacan. We arrive at the gates an hour later to be told it is closed for the rest of the day because they already hit capacity. Our driver recommends a canal area on the south side of town so we go for it. Almost another hour and a half later we arrive. We get tacos from a stand and hop on a colorful boat. The canal is jam packed with other boats, but the weather is great, the vibes are great, and there's beer in a bucket. Various vendors in canoes who pull up along side us to offer their goods. A woman is frying tortillas in one. In another a man is roasting corn. Some canoes have mariachi bands who will board boats and play for passengers. One canoe has a DJ who appears to be shooting a music video. After about an hour of bumper boat madness we break off down a quiet canal. The whole experience is lovely and nowhere near the tourist trap I was worried it might be. Back to the hotel to put on some Plan 9 from Outer Space for just a bit. Hanky Panky for cocktails and snacks. Just as we are about to leave we meet Ali and Amy, US & Canadian nomads who have been bouncing between Turkey and Mexico since September. We close down the bar chatting with them.<br><br>Neither of is feels 100% today so we take it easy, get some more tacos, tepache, and a quesadilla from down the street, and make out way back home.	19.283160, -99.093693	Apr 16, 2021	Apr 19, 2021																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rp9QuWsmPHydD73S7
Yellowstone National Park	Triple Parked	244	x	We nab the last spot at the Lewis Lake campsite and setup the tent. There is still a bit of light in the sky, so we drive to West Thumb, a hot spring and mud pot cluster. There are hundreds of craters in the ground ranging in size from toilet bowl to backyard pool. The liquid spectrum is clay slip to phone screen protector. All of the springs have water runoff, on which live bacterial mats that can take on colors like hot dog mustard, old car rust, gender confirming blue, and classic brown. The bits of old runoff which aren't actively wet are porcelain white; deposits of sodium carbonate the water had absorbed from the limestone below. I learn that Yellowstone National Park exists as the latex skin of a forty-mile diameter magma balloon which is being continuously filled. One day the balloon will pop and make the Earth unrecognizable for tens of thousands of years. Until then it will heat the water table and give life to the geysers, hot springs, and mud pots. I spot some people with cameras crowding together, usually a good sign. I walk over and see a big elk bull and a few elk cows. The bull looks horny and not pleased about the spectators. He looks at us, opens his mouth, and makes a loud scream akin to a child who is first learning to play a trumpet. We don't stick around much longer. Back to the campsite where our neighbor, Anthony, has a fire going. We make a peace offering of beer and join around the glow while we chat about Tucson and eat cold pizza. It is so cold out that we don't even consider sleeping in the already setup tent. I grab the blanket and bags from it and we settle into the back of the Jeep.<br><br>First stop is Old Faithful. We, very fortunately, get there only about twenty minutes before the next eruption is due to begin. We join the very large crowd and, before long, see it do its thing. It was the most viewed and least beautiful sight we'd see in the entire trip. Next to Grand Prismatic Spring, which is definitely one of the coolest sights of the trip. The microbial mats are so strongly colored, that the steam rising from the water takes on a rainbow spectrum. After failing to get signal for a while in Madison, we head to Canyon Village to check out the waterfalls and "Yellowstone Grand Canyon". The upper and lower falls are both stunning and the canyon is a feast for the senses I could easily spend hours taking in. Unfortunately, we didn't have that long. Our goal was to reach Hayden Valley, a vast grassy meadow, which we heard is perfect for wildlife viewing. A few minutes into the plains and we spot elk in the distance as well as bison, lots of bison. We park above a river and watch a few dozen bovines feed, drink, swim, and nap. The entire valley is steeped in tones of gold, straw, and amber. I am zoomed in at 300mm, taking in the gorgeous beasts and absorbed in the light and color. Time slows down a while. Slower than I expected, the light eventually fades and the even chill quickly kicks in. We drive to the nearest town, Gardiner, where we eat mediocre pizza and find a spot off the side of a road to park.<br><br>Up at six, which I will later find out wasn't early enough to see a pack of wolves chase a grizzly bear across the plains of Lamar Valley. We do arrive just after that though and are able to catch, very far off, a few wolves playing a game of bite the bison. Further down the road about thirty bison are not only right next to the road, but are crossing it regularly, ever in search of the finest blade of grass to ruminate on. It makes for a perfect glamour shots session. We drive next to Mammoth Hot Springs where we chat with a few very friendly and knowledgeable rangers on topics like ranger uniform history, the evolution of forest fire management, and the idiosyncrasies of elk behavior. We first walk, then drive through Mammoth Hot Springs, which are unique in that the calcium carbonate deposits form stunning stepped travertine terraces. The thousand-year in the making sculptures look as though they were taken from the depths of cave. The bone white crust surrounding the active thermal areas adds to the eerie otherworldliness of the place. The day is still young and we are mentally finished with parking so we decide to drive to Spokane. Seven or so hours later we pickup two more duck banh mi, check into our hotel by the airport, and dream of things much bigger, and older, than ourselves.	44.648575, -110.458950	Sep 9, 2020	Sep 11, 2020		Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park	4	47.657073, -117.423957	48.687073, -113.741580	43.761419, -110.732252	44.648575, -110.458950										https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9
Grand Teton National Park	Triple Parked	243	x	After a two-hour drive we're in Jackson, Wyoming. To a nice cafe for a delicious egg salad on toast and a five-mushroom latte. We drive to the southern tip of Jenny Lake. The Tetons are majestic: jagged and jutting suddenly upward from the flat valley due to one tectonic plate crashing with and slipping under another. There are a few small glaciers on the mountains, but they are melting fast and will be gone in a decade or so. We take a ferry and hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. It seems it snowed heavily last night and now big hunks of snow are falling from the tall pines. Early on I get smacked in the head by a big white dump. The hike is nice, but the ground is cold and wet, which my sock/sandal combo doesn't love. From above, Liz spots an entrancing vortex pattern in the intersecting ferry wakes. By the end of the hike the snow is melting to the point that it looks like it's raining from the trees. The sky is cloudless and blue. It's surreal. Back to Jackson where we order two large pizzas. We park in a camp spot that is already reserved. They pull in while we are brushing our teeth and aren't pleased. We find a new, unreserved spot and get real cold.<br><br>Apparently moose are quite plentiful in this area. I keep looking for them. As we drive back into Jackson to a coffee shop for drinks and a breakfast bagel sandwich, my eyes play tricks on me. Every dark tree in the distance is a potential moose. This is how people see Jesus in a dog's butt. Liz spots our server from the pizza restaurant at the grocery store. We visit the most-photographed barn in the world and take pictures of the barn next to it. Further north to Coulter Bay where we hike around a nice peninsula that wants to be an island. At the General Store we eat very good huckleberry ice cream. Continuing north we enter Yellowstone.	43.761419, -110.732252	Sep 8, 2020	Sep 9, 2020		Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park	3	47.657073, -117.423957	48.687073, -113.741580	43.761419, -110.732252	44.648575, -110.458950										https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9
Glacier National Park	Triple Parked	242	x	In St. Regis we stop for roadside cherries and a huckleberry milkshake. To Kalispell for gas & groceries and then Blankenship Bridge where we camp along the river bank.<br><br>Up at 4:30. At 6 Logan Pass is already filling up. We catch some more sleep and get up around 7:30 to start hiking. Our plan was to do the Highline Trail, but a friendly ranger offers some better advice. First we do the Hidden Lake hike, a three-mile hike to a...hidden lake. On our hike Liz points out the moon. I say, "Oh, hi!" and point to it, but a woman in the path thinks I'm pointing at her. I tell her sorry, I was just saying hi to the moon. The lake is closed because of bear activity, but it is a nice view. There is a goat a few feet from me. At one point I think he might charge, but he puts his head down and continues chomping. We sit on a rock and eat peanut butter. Some ground squirrels are very interested in us. Later, a ranger will tell us her name for them, Little Cannibals. Apparently, when one gets hit by a car, others go out to eat it, and then also get hit by cars, resulting in a squirrel pile up. A Hoary Marmot poses for us for a good while. We relax in the car for a bit before we begin the Highline trail. The whole trail is 16 miles, so we opt to only do about a mile in and out. There are some narrow cliff sections, which are pretty scary. The view is incredible. There are something like three dozen glaciers in the park. All are a fraction of the size they were a few decades ago. They will likely all melt in my lifetime. What we think might be a pika says hi. We drive to the end of Going to the Sun Road, then back. To Josephine's for a bison gyro and fried chicken. Back to camp along the river where we chat with our neighbors and drink wine. The Milky Way hangs above.<br><br>The night was beautiful and just a bit cool, but at 7am the winds pick up and a serious cold front visits the region. Our next four days will be much colder than we packed for. We had booked a rafting trip, but when we get to the office they inform us it has been cancelled due to the wind. Our next stop is the Montana Mystery House & Vortex, which seemed like a quirky art installation on Atlas Obscura. However, in speaking to the desk attendant and seeing the gift shop it feels a lot more like a scheme designed to prey on the naive. Speaking of schemes designed to prey on the naive, just down the road from the Mystery House is a trailer semi-encircled by about 15 billboards, featuring the Ten Commandments, and statements about Jesus' ability to save my soul. I stop. Inside is a gift shop selling very large t-shirts, embroidered face masks, and car magnets; all detailing either the Ten Commandments or the healing properties of Jesus. I ask about the masks. The attendant tells me about the pastor in Oregon who believes we don't need masks (because god will heal us), but whom was instructed by God to make them to help financially support the church. He mentioned something about a divine discovery of an embroidery machine. I leave, but not before he tells me about how his Columbia shoes were very durable on his mission in Indonesia. Gyro & falafel in Missoula. In Idaho Falls we get a hotel, go to Walmart to buy long-sleeved shirts, and begin watching I'm Thinking of Ending Things.	48.687073, -113.741580	Sep 5, 2020	Sep 7, 2020		Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park	2	47.657073, -117.423957	48.687073, -113.741580	43.761419, -110.732252	44.648575, -110.458950										https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9
Spokane	Triple Parked	241	x	We are given a Jeep, which is very nice to drive. After ten minutes we are downtown. Our first stop is Thai On First. Dine in is closed, so we eat the pad see ew in the car. It is hot and salty and delicious. I am aware of how many homeless-looking people there are. We drive south through a cute neighborhood. Some of the quirky homes remind me how conservative Dallas is. We get water, beer, hard kombucha, and chips from a grocery store. Down the road is Manito Park, where we get out and eat a watery Massaman curry next to a small lake. We walk and find a French garden full of flowers and bees being bees. Back downtown, we stop into two vintage shops. I am tempted by scratched Paul Simon vinyl and a porch swing made from the bench of an old Ferris wheel. We check into the Historic Davenport and check out for a bit. The sun is now low in the sky. We pop out and walk to Riverfront Park where we feed the Garbage Goat, sit beneath the big top, and view the falls. We get a very good duck banh mi from Wild Sage and eat it in the room. For the second half of dinner we get a salad and Gorgonzola fries from Downriver Grill and also eat that in the room. We stop by the milk bottle, but it is not lit up.<br><br>We get free breakfast with our room so we head down. I order the crab omelette, which is okay and Liz has a salmon benedict. Back in the room we test out the mattress. Next to REI to buy poop bags. On the road east and to Coeur D'Alene Coffee Co. for some very nice drinks. Our plan was to stay here tonight, but in doing more research we decide it's best to head straight to Glacier. We walk by the lake and then drive east.	47.657073, -117.423957	Sep 4, 2020	Sep 5, 2020		Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park	1	47.657073, -117.423957	48.687073, -113.741580	43.761419, -110.732252	44.648575, -110.458950										https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9
Albuquerque	Hot Air	240	x	After work on Friday, Sean, Ash, Liz and I drive up north and share a cheap motel for the night.<br><br>We drive for most of the day, but stop in a small town to eat and buy chambray shirts. We are in Albuquerque by the afternoon. We play a bit of Frisbee on the side of the highway with balloons dotting the sky and head to Ash's friends place where we have some drinks and crash for the night.<br><br>For some stupid reason, Ash and I don't get up in the morning to see the balloons take off, but Liz and Sean do. We head to a diner and eat breakfast. Ash's friend takes us on a nature walk, where Sean and I slow dance in the mud. We check out downtown for a bit and head to Miguel & Maria's house to catch up for a bit. We drive back through the desert. We stop in a pretty area. Ash and I run through the sand a bit. We find a very rusty car frame. As the sun is setting we find an abandoned gas station/house. Ash slides down into the pool. Sean and I climb in the cabinets.	35.197680, -106.596904	Oct 7, 2010	Oct 9, 2010	Sean, Ash, Miguel, Maria																https://photos.app.goo.gl/ueK7iMmLdfBEscho9
Boston	A Birthday Celebration in	239		We land and are hungry, so we head straight to Futago Udon near Fenway. Liz gets a creamy uni udon and I get one with curry and fried chicken. Both are very good. The servers are Chinese. Someone asks for a box for their leftover udon and they give them one. We are definitely in America. We walk to the Time Out Market where we watch video of ballet dancers playing on an old train station time table. We are stuffed, but there is an orange cardamom poppy donut I want, so we get that and a coffee. We go to Back Bay to shop, but don't like anything. We walk east through the first public in America. It is pretty dead, but there are some cute chubby squirrels building nests. We walk for a bit longer and then get a ride to the hotel and nap. Kelly and Chris come by and we catch up for a few before heading to dinner at Forage. We have some yummy cocktails plus root charcuterie, a cheese plate, sunchokes with cacao & tarragon emulsion, house pimento marscapone, roasted carrots, and veg ferments. More cocktails and then blueberry rose with chocolate cake, apple crumble, oak smoke icecream with caramel fongarde. We talk about being pee shy and wide urethras. We are tired so we head home, chat some more and sleep. <br><br>Breakfast buffet with really good French Toast. We drive to Worcester. Liz and Kelly go to pick up alcohol and a dog. Chris bakes a strawberry cake for Kelly's birthday party tonight. I nap. We order sandwiches and stick poke tattoos. I get 'ouch' on my knee. The party people come and we have a nice time for a good while. I chat about material science, slasher movies, and thigh cancer. We stay up late. More stick poking is done and we eventually get a Lyft to the airport.	42.379146, -71.127088	Feb 8, 2020	Feb 9, 2020	K$man & Chris	Boston, Worcester															
Southern Australia	Great Ocean Road	238	x	On the flight I eat dry pasta and watch Fleabag. It is very entertaining. I take the train to the hotel and find Liz waiting for me in bed. We cuddle for a few and she heads to work. I sleep. After some failed internet login I opt to meditate and work out. I told myself I wouldn't drink caffeine on this trip. I'm already feeling it. I decide to check out a nearby art gallery...which it turns out I've already been to. The art, however, is all different and even better than last time. My favorite piece is a very large balloon that is on a loop of being inflated and deflated. At its peak, it pushes up against both walls and the ceiling. I also am quite fond of the pile of rubble, which is breathing. I get some fake meat and potato chips from a Chinese convenience store. I snack, dress, and walk. Liz meets me and we have a lovely dinner at sixpenny including kangaroo tartare, grouper with celeriac sauce and champagne foam, lovely beef, and Mead custard. Train and walk to Scout for some weird yummy drinks.<br><br>I sleep until 1. Liz gave me her drink voucher, so I head down to the bar where I have an XPA and chat with Joseph, the bartender, for a good while. I walk to Lankan Filling station and meet Liz for delicious Sri Lankan curries and hoppers. Then we get a ride to the Opera House and see the Marriage of Figaro, which is excellent and hard to follow, both in plot and music. We walk to Maybe Sammy for fancy drinks. We walk next to Employees Only, but don't like the basic drink club vibe, so we opt to go to bed. <br><br>Up early for our flight to Adelaide. Liz sleeps and I watch Parasite. We take a bus downtown. The town is a bit run down and there are many down and out folks hanging around. It is also charming with beautiful architecture and many cool looking shops. We stop by Lord of the Fries for poutine. We wander the high street for a good bit and I save Liz from sitting on bird poop. We walk down to Central Market and pick up cheese, terrine, kiwi, jam and tomatoes right before they close. We head back north and come upon a big square where we lie on the grass and sun ourselves for a good while. Hungry Jack's (Burger King) sells a vegan Rebel Whopper, son we try one and it is delicious. Next we head towards the Botanic Gardens where we take in the beautiful plants and birds for a good bit before heading to the airport to pick up our bags and a car. A good long drive. I see a kangaroo bounce across the road. We get to Cape Jervis, where we stay in a room for the night. There are many millipedes outside. We snack on a loaf of bread the folks at Sixpenny gave us, soft and hard cheese, fig jam, and terrine.<br><br>Up early and to the ferry over to Kangaroo Island where we get a rental car and drive west. We are on the lookout for roos immediately. We see about 4, but they are all roadkill so far. We get to Frogs & Roses, which is a lovely restaurant, nursery, and home. We say hi to Morris, the donkey, as well as some chickens, and a bulldog. After a mediocre lime milkshake and a sage & rosemary pizza, we head on. We go to Flinders Chase, a large park at the western tip of the island. A silly ranger informs me that roos sleep during the day so gave us some things to do for a few hours before coming back to the roo zone. Onward to the century-old lighthouse and the fur seal hangout spot, Admiral's Arch. We see some fight and are able to get quite close. They smell like the zoo. We finish our picnic food and head to Remarkable Rock, which is an apt description. It looks like something Gaudi designed. We return to the visitor's center where we begin our walk. Immediately we see an echidna snuffling along. We follow him a while and, although we are right next to him, he appears to be completely unaware of us. We walk on and see many fluffy balls in the trees, which are sleepy koalas. They are all over. The we see three kangaroos feeding. Then two more. Then five off in the distance. We walk into a clearing and they are all over. Some are lying down, some are feeding, some are hopping around. The sun is low, there are geese around, and everything is beautiful. We are in a miniature world of animals and I can hardly believe it. We stroll through this for a good while and then head back to the car. When we're almost there I realize my keys are not in my pocket. After ensuring they are not on me I realize for certain that I dropped them somewhere on our 1.5km forest walk. Fuck. The sun is low in the sky. I take of my coat and start running. I explore the echidna area; nothing. I run for about ten minutes, scanning the forest floor as quickly as I can. Fuck. Just keep looking. There they are! In a spot where I stopped to shoot a roo for a few. I am so relieved. Liz and I reunite, she laughs, all is good. We drive back through the gorgeous fading sky and see many hoppers on and along the road. Into Kingscote where we eat eggplant Parmesan and drink wine at the one restaurant that is still open. To our cute hotel just down the road for a tuck in. <br><br>To the ferry and across. Our driver is lovely and teaches us about some of the local cockatoo varieties. She also recommends a nice lunch spot and winery on our way out of town called Penny's Hill. We head up there, taste some very nice wines, and eat Mediterranean dips, yummy potatoes, and a kimchi toastie. We pick up a few bottles and head to the Cube. There are many modern Victorian style nickel machines. The art on the ground floor is somewhat charming, with a Meow Wolf story-like quality, but mostly feels about 15 years out of date. The Dali stuff is pretty cool, but his paintings are definitely better. Wine tasting is included with our entrance so we do that and really enjoy the sav blanc and the dessert sav blanc, so we get those. Barossa Valley is two hours away so we start driving. For some reason maps has us go through a bunch of farms and some unpaved road, but it is absolutely gorgeous. We arrive at the B&B, nap, then chat with our host for a few before going out for "The Best Pizza in Australia". The place did not seem promising, however the pizzas, loaded with local German-style meats, were delicious. <br><br>Sophia made us a breakfast of fried eggs and rashers. We then proceeded to do some computer stuff and sip port for the next few hours. Over to Maggie Beer's farm for a cheese plate and some sav blanc. We attempt another place, but it turns out it's just a processing facility. We drive through many palm trees and then head to Two Hands, where we do a tasting of some strong German Shirazes. Relax for a bit. I teach Peter, Sophie's son, The Hall of the Mountain King on piano and then to Musque for dinner. We are too late to do the tasting menu so we order scallops, smoked salmon, smoked tomatoes caprese, buttermilk salad, fries, and a Tasmanian g&t. <br><br>Another breakfast and we're off. I drove for 8 hours to get us to Warrnambool, a cute town and the western tip of the Great Ocean Road. We relax for a few in the motel, then head out for Thai. We get the same thing we always get, which is Massaman Curry and Pad See Ewe. Both are delicious. We walk to the theater and watch Joker, which left us both feeling a bit let down and even a tad angry. To the hotel where we talk film theory and finish a bottle of white. <br><br>It is raining. It will all day. We hang out in Bright Bird for a few hours, drink some lovely coffee, eat a delicious shakshuka & potato hash with cauliflower puree, and do some work. To Target where Liz gets a hoodie. Drive to Childer's Cove, which is gorgeous, but very wet and windy. Next we head to cheese world where we get some yummy cheese and find a nice marble cheese plate. Down the GORD to London Bridge, Loch Ard Gorge, and the Twelve (seven left) Apostles. We wrap up the night in Apollo Bay at the GORD Brewhouse, where we have some beers, a nice meal of nachos & fish 'n chips, and sleep upstairs.<br><br>Our day is spent completing the GORD. First we do a waterfall hike. We snack on some jalapeno & honey cheddar. Up a steep hill for a Teddy's Lookout over the town and bay. We work our way up and stop by Anglesea Golf Club to do a kangaroo tour. Ian drives us through the ground of the course as we get to see scores of roo'd boys and girls hanging out on the greens. We grab another Rebel Whopper before heading into Melbourne, dropping off the car, and having some Shiraz in the hotel. A nice older man who knows a lot about Australian water infrastructure drives us to Naked for Satan, where we discovere the kitchen is closed. We walk and discover that next door is a Mexican restaurant and bar called Little Hop, which smells delicious. Five tacos, two quesadillas, four gorditas, a beer, and a sangria later we can verify that it is, in fact, very delicious. We walk over to Above Board, a super minimalist cocktail bar with lovely bartenders and excellent drinks. <br><br>Our first stop for the day is Lune, a pastry shop recently voted the best croissant is Melbourne. We have a caccio e pepe circle, a ham & cheese croissant, and a lemon curd cruffin. They are indeed superlative. We will return tomorrow. To Dangerfield where Liz finds a cute dress and earrings with eyeballs in them. To UNIQLO for socks. We take a but to Three Bags Full where we have very nice coffees, Liz gets a potato hash with beef cheek, and I order a chorizo shakshuka. We head to the hotel to relax for a bit. We finish the red from last night and walk to Gingerboy for tartare w/creme fraiche, various very good dumplings, Korean chicken wings, and cocktails. We head back to the hotel and watch The Last Jedi.<br><br>Back to Lune for a plain croissant, a ham & cheese croissant, a pan au chocolate, an almond croissant and great coffee. We walk to Holy Moly and play 27 holes of fun, wacky, spooky mini golf, and get free visors. Next we walk to Heartbreaker to fucking good, greasy pizza and weird beer: barrel aged g&t ale and a habanero & rosewater corn lager. From there we head to the airport and fly to Sydney. I meet Liz, Gabriel, and Manav in the lounge for a few, then we head to Cho-Cho San to meet Michael and Mark for a nice Japanese dinner with cocktails and an unenthused waitor lady. It is immediately awesome to see them again and it feels like everyone is having a great time. The place is shutting down, as is the whole neighborhood, so we get a cab to a nearby Texan style salloon for beer and Pina Coladas. We are all feeling tired and everyone but me has an early morning, so we hug and part ways.<br><br>I wake up, iron Liz's dress, going her for a quick bite, and see her off. I proceed to clean up, fiddle on the computer, and eventually head to Cross Eatery for a burnt cauliflower with kimchi toastie and a Wattle seed cola.	-34.501490, 138.983492	Oct 30, 2019	Nov 12, 2019		Adelaide, Kangaroo Island, Barossa Valley, Great Ocean Road, Melbourne, Sydney		-33.856782, 151.215303	-34.916926, 138.608874	-36.047669, 136.756198	-35.246295, 138.550847	-34.501463, 138.983502	-38.385122, 142.490493	-38.758727, 143.670283	-37.815414, 144.954807	-33.869516, 151.225307					https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6
Izumo	Birthplace	237	x	At the airport McDonald's, I accidentally order only one hash brown and get very angry. I realize how dumb I am being and stop. We fly on a plane and ride on two buses. Then we are at Izumo-Taisha, which is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. Liz informs me that the Japanese word for October translates roughly to 'without gods'. It is called that because in October all of the Shinto gods in Japan leave their shrines and come to Izumo-Taisha to hang out. Liz finds a beautiful little frog. Then she finds a praying mantis on the main shrine gate. Then she finds a beautiful beetle on a sign post. Were these creatures the gods in earthly forms? Yes. Now we walk in the sun and arrive at Tanakaya, a quaint restaurant which serves homemade soba in the Izumo style. They process the buckwheat with the hull included, this making the noodles darker, coarser, and earthier. The noodles are served on three trays, each with a different topping (foam, daikon, egg). Our server brings us a pot of pasta water, serves us a cup, and pours a splash of dashi in it. We get on a bus and ride through the windy mountains to the edge of the peninsula. There is another nice old shrine there so we get out and explore it. Older people here talk to us as though we speak the language. It is quite charming. We start walking towards the ocean, but Liz sees a cat, then two more, then two more. She approaches slowly. They are sunning and cleaning; they don't run off. We spend the next half hour sitting in the street playing with some sweet babes. The cheeky boy is especially fond of Liz. He climbs into her lap, she cradles him, and they fall in love. We walk up the mountain. Small shops are selling beautiful sea shells and blowfish with googly-eyes attached. I very nearly step on a praying mantis. We get to the lighthouse. It is white brick against a white sky. We walk along a cliff and lean out over rough, foamy, emerald ocean. We bus back to town. Liz has a headache and sleeps. I work on my resume. Two hours later we get up and head to Taste, a Brooklyn inspired restaurant. The tiny room is full, but the owner comes out and constructs a table out of saw horses for us in the parking lot. Craft beer, potato salad, fried olives, mushroom and duck salad, tuna tartar. Liz drops a piece of tuna on the ground. I consciously turn around for a few seconds. It is gone. I'm still hungry so we get chicken wings. Liz is messaging with Kyle, who informs her that he and his friend were just nearly victims of a hate crime stabbing. He is fine, but we are shaken. Walking home, we stop into a conbini and get ice cream. Liz's is rich milk. Mine is sweet potato and comes in a cardboard-like cone, which quite closely resembles the look and feel of a sweet potato.<br><br>We sleep until 9:50. Checkout is at 10:00. I shave in the lobby bathroom. We walk down the canal. An old man looks at us, tells us something, and flaps his arms behind his back. He points behind a low bridge. Below the bridge is a large, white crane. It is feeding on small fish and is majestic in the shade. Into a cafe next door. The wood is dark from years of wear, the furniture is post-war. There are huge potted plants in concrete. Liz says it smells like her grandparents' house when Hans was alive. We eat gratin, fish, and chicken. I nearly fall asleep at the table. We had intended to go to a nearby onsen town, but the bus ride costly, so we opt to go bowling instead. The building looks nearly abandoned. There are only squat toilets. The lanes are very oily and on my first throw I slip and bang my knee on the wood. I focus on my form and center of gravity. Liz and I tie the first game at 109. We both beat our scores in the second game with Liz at 120 and me at 137, which is likely my personal best. I rent ping pong paddles and look for Liz. I find her at a slot machine in the kids arcade. She wins two of three games. I eat a not-good melon pan at the airport and I fly home. Liz doesn't make the first flight, so she watches The Handmaid's Tale for three hours at the airport.	35.433922, 132.628204	Oct 5, 2019	Oct 6, 2019																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/qGxbWhofwwo7hR9v6
Kyoto	Final Round	236	x	We have sushi from a plastic tray in the airport. We land outside of Osaka and take the monorail to the Expo '70 Park. We have tickets to see the newly reopened interior of the Tower of the Sun. The inside features a zig-zagging staircase, which works its way up around the Tree of Life, which is more like and upturned root upon which are mounted animatronic (not operating, unfortunately) plaster creatures. From low to high they are meant to represent the progress of evolution of life on Earth. The gorilla's head is missing, leaving behind only hydraulic pumps and metal jaws. We take two trains and a bus to Ryoanji temple. It is very cool, green, and mossy. We take off our shoes and walk on soft, old wood. There is a rock feature where six large rocks are surrounded by a pond of beautifully raked pebbles. We wander the complex and find a seven-legged spider constructing a scribbly web. We get a sparkling apple and jelly drink and get on a very crowded bus heading for the center of town. We go by Kichi Kichi Omurice, not expecting to get in, but are let in. We order the classic Omurice and a beef stew. The man with purple hair puts on a fun show of making the rice. It is all yummy and we eat it very quickly. We take a bus to a food hall, where we find The Roots of All Evil - Little Evil: celery gin, black Sambuca, plum wine. Ghost Note: gin, absinthe, bonito, matcha, grapefruit, honey. Liz sees the bartender drink from the mixing spoon multiple times. We have a mediocre donut and bus back north. We head to nokishika711 gin and cocktail labo for: Fungus Negroni: Shitake gin, amaro, sake, shoyu, umami bitters, fermented mushroom; The Roots: gin (burdock, cardamom, coriander, cinnamon), fermented burdock bitters, ginger ale, rosemary, ginger shoot, cucumber. The drinks are great. We walk back through the touristy area. A young guy is covering Tears in Heaven. Not far a way is a man in an fold-open van wearing a duck hat, singing with a duck toy in his mouth, and entertaining a good crowd. His van says He is Starduck Tony.<br><br>We check our of hotel #1. We walk to Koe donuts for a wasanbon and a pistachio cake donut. We continue to a nice little shop for cold brew. Northward to Aoonigiri for salmon & salmon roe, curry chicken, miso & negi, and tofu & bonito onigiri sets. The owner has a monk-like quality and the restaurant feels sacred and hushed. Next we get on a cute train, with outward facing seats, up to the mountains. We arrive at Kurama, a Tengu-inspired mountain shrine hike. We hike up in gorgeous cool weather. We hike down in the rain. We learn that Liz's rain jacket isn't actually all that water resistant. We get back to the hotel and change into what warm clothes we have. After a while we get up and walk to Cocina Órale for margaritas, chips & salsa, nachos and delicious tacos. We walk just a couple of minutes and return to nokishika711 for Soil & Pimp Sessions: burdock gin, black soybean bitters, whisky, tonic, herbs, soil. Silly Symphony: porcini gin, chestnut, yogurt, soda, fermented mushroom, honey, egg white, chocolate. Fly Me to the Moon: spice gin, Suze, sake, ginseng bitters, moon candy, pumpkin flake.	35.116725, 135.766938	Sep 21, 2019	Sep 22, 2019																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/6tn69bRT6FWG4WQT6
Da Nang	Southern Vietnam	235	x	At 9:30 we get a call from the from desk to remind us that breakfast is closing soon. We eat. It is surprisingly good. I meditate for the first time in a few days. I fantasize about sex as a distraction from the discomfort of stillness. Our driver from last night takes us to My Son. Back-lit cattails beard rust brick rubble piles. This is a nursing home for retired buildings. Moss liver spots. The beings lean to one side. Many require support to sit upright. Some show obvious cosmetic work. All are thinning on top. Tufts of shrubbery grow from strange new nooks. They are very old. They exist now only to remind us of how life used to be. I am briefly tempted to kick one. It is cloudy, we are sweaty. There are loud, unfamiliar insects. I can hear gongs and drums in the distance. When I get to where I think the sound originated, there is nothing there. We hydrate and leave. We are dropped right into Hoi An Old Town. The sun is setting and there are hundreds of cloth lanterns out. We hit the food stalls. Banana pancake with Nutella. Vietnamese pizza, unsure what it was exactly. Sticky rice banana. We sit at a street-side cafe and have beers. A young girl tries to sell us lanterns, two times. She is very adorable and Liz decides to give her a couple of dollars. She hugs Liz and kisses her on the cheek. Liz looks ready to cry. We are very sticky and decide to have a Banh Mi and call it a night.<br><br>At breakfast a kind woman makes me a very strong coffee and gives another man the waffle I made. We take the shuttle to Old Town. The sky is old dishwasher and it's being wrung out over the whole of the region today. We find a Banh My stand with a long line and get it. They put at three different sauce spreads and four different types of meat on this. The bread is very french and newborn. It is the best thing we've eaten in Vietnam. There are so many flavors at once and interesting changes from bite to bite. I can't comprehend it, but I love it. We walk through miniature lakes and rivers. We wade upstream and find a spa. We get decent foot massages. My hairy legs need about 300% more oil than Liz's. I meditate in the car on the way to Da Nang. Get to the hotel and relaxed. We look for the hot tub, but there isn't one. It's still quite rainy out and we are feeling a recuperative type of night so we touch good and get Indian. The lamb korma is the best I've ever tasted and the chicken Tikka Masala is unique and delicious.<br><br>We finish the delicious curry cold then top it off with a mediocre hotel buffet. Hai picks us up and drives us to Ba Na Hills, a Vietnam Disneyland. He plays techno at a soft volume. We ride a very long cable car and arrive. We spend the next few hours exploring Medieval Square, Buddhism World, Big Hands Bridge, and Jules Verne Arcade. I am slightly disappointed at the absence of a Communism Cafe or Viet-Cong Village. We ride a two-person roller coaster. We eat Vietnamese doughnut balls, a sausage on a stick, and a strawberry smoothie. We wander a lot and head to the arcade. We play a Crusin' USA type game and basketball game, which Liz does exceptionally well at. Back to the hotel for a nap. We wake and get a ride to Hải Sản Đà Nẵng Nhà hàng Bé Mặn, a point-to-your-dinner seafood hall, which appears to be quite popular with the locals. We get eight chili garlic shrimp, two big blue langoustines, ten green sauce oysters, Morning Glory, fried rice, and some beers. Afterward, we walk down the beach. There are many little crabs running around. I manage to chase one who runs sideways with his pincers up. We come back and watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.<br><br>Breakfast and face masks, so-so massages, more superlative Indian, and then we head to the airport. We fly there to HCMC, but on the flight Liz starts feeling unwell. We land and she goes to the bathroom for a while. She has diarrhea, is vomiting and is having intense stomach pains, which increase in severity. She lies on a bench in the Departure terminal. We decide not to to fly to Tokyo tonight. We decide to get a cab and a hotel, but she can't even stand up to walk to the car pickup. Eventually she is able to walk and we decide to go to the hospital. We get a ride and go in the local hospital first. It is pretty depressing and no one speaks English. I try filling out a form in Vietnamese. A man wearing only pants runs out yelling in pain. I see hospital beds with blood stains on them. One of the staff manages to tell me that the international clinic is actually the next building over. We go there and it is a much nicer experience immediately. A doctor very quickly diagnoses Liz as having food poisoning and prescribes her some pain and nausea medication. She comes out to the lobby where I am waiting with our bags, but he quickly calls her back again. I wait for about 40 minutes. I hear the occasional yelp of pain. She is the only person in there and I begin to worry. I eventually inquire as to what is happening. Apparently they gave Liz a cot to lie on. I find her sleeping there, but still in a lot of pain. Soon she gets up and we get a ride to a cheap airport hotel.<br><br>I walk to get water, Pocari Sweat, and McDonald's. She seems to be feeling considerably better and eats all of her food. She sleeps more and I meditate and look for jobs. We watch The King of Comedy and Shock Treatment, which make for a pretty fun double feature. On the plane I watch Inside Out and cry deeply.	16.056932, 108.246375	Aug 28, 2019	Sep 2, 2019		Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang		15.878503, 108.331998	16.056932, 108.246375	15.996980, 107.989971											https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6
Ho Chi Min City	Southern Vietnam	234	x	Getting here seemed unnecessarily stressful. I felt slighted when the bus driver charged me double fare to account for my suitcase. Realizing that the cost of two fares combined totaled about $.50 helped, a little. Traffic is chaotic. Motorcycles appear as cells in a large amoeba. Lots of coughing and hacking. The bus is clean. The driver takes off his shoes before getting into his chair. An old man is meditating in the median of a busy street. Couples are playing badminton in the park. The air is hazy like Santorini. People wear loose-fitting face masks and helmets. I stop on a bridge and record the sound of mostly motorcycles. I get in, meet Cori, and catch up. We are both quite tired so we sleep. Hours later we are up. I grab a bitter, unsweetened coffee and spicy nori from 7/11. We chat a bit, talk with Sean, and go for a walk. It is pouring, but completely dies off in less than two minutes. Our first stop is Tung I'm Hungry for Pho Kho Ga. The noodles are dry. The woman who served them pours many condiments on top and mixes them all together. It is sweet, spicy, peanuty, and herbaceous. There is also a meat-stock soup. We talk about The Spell of the Sensuous, a few other books, and single-celled organisms. We walk again for a while. We arrive at Workshop, a Third Wave shop, and have a local espresso latte. It's complex and reminds me of going down on a woman. V60, passion fruit cheesecake, and pumpkin roll round it off. Young cats hang out on a motorcycle. We slowly wander back. I mediate and Cori stretches. Liz arrives. We all catch up and eat English chocolate. We get a ride to Hum, which is a vegetarian restaurant owned by the same people who run Uu Dam Chay in Hanoi. We eat loads of delicious veggies, pecan fried rice, panang tofu pucks, young banana, and doughnut balls. We wander the streets looking for either a massage or a bar. We eventually settle on Below Whisky Den. There is a group of 8 people clapping loudly and in poor sync with TLC's Waterfalls. We order and drink some very good stuff. Mine is whiskey forward and delicious. Liz's tastes like Cold Stone Cake Batter™ ice cream. A guy from the Bronx plays a set of covers ranging from Johnny Cash for Jeff Buckley. He sounds good and blesses us. We are very tired.<br><br>Liz has a headache. Cori is working. I read some Douglas Adams and eat nori. I go for a walk, wander through a local market. The colors, lighting, angles, smells, and sounds overwhelm me. Raw meat is being chopped on a counter. A woman is gutting a fish. Shrimp in a bowl of water. A big rat scurrying in the dim light. Stacks of packages I can not understand. I buy coconut, which a master drains and de-meats into a bag in seconds. It starts to rain. It starts to pour. I stand in the shop and listen to it. Back. Liz is up and feeling slightly better. We eat coconut. The three of us head back out to the market. I see a woman cooking something that looks like a bright green pancake. We get one, it is coconut and pandan and delicious. We also get a fried plantain and some other fried ball. We walk through the market and see many beautiful vegetables and fruits. Shrimp are jumping out of baskets. Eggs coated in charcoal. Chicken feet. A pigs head. A cage packed full of chickens. Frogs tied together with plastic. We head to a stall and get a noodle soup with tomato, fish cake, snails, and a blood brick. The broth is pleasant. It was Bun Rieu. We find another fried plantain stand and have that. There is some fun workout equipment and we play on that for a bit. We walk to Workshop for more coffee and passion fruit cheesecake. Now to get feet massages, which is nice nice. We go by two different kitchenware stores and find some salt dishes and chopsticks. Liz found a place that looks promising called Racha, so we head there for dinner. We order some great cocktails. For food we get: charcoal tempura calamari, beef mint salad, fried silken tofu, duck shiitake dumplings, wagyu gyoza, crab lemongrass wontons, spare ribs, and beef tongue with rice crackers. It is all very yummy. Back at home we play Name That Crease™ with Sean.<br><br>I wake up. It's 10:30. Liz had a headache in the night, but is feeling better now. I make a coffee and we snack on nori. Cori comes back from a workout and I improvise a song and dance for her return. We take our time and eventually head out. We get a delicious banana coconut drink. The massage place is full, but we make an appointment. Walk to My Banh Mi for chicken lemongrass with spicy garlic, and coconut pork with black pepper cream, plus a side of spring roll. A man, who we later presume is the owner, tells us about the origin of mole, Caesar salad and chimichangas. We look briefly and the Notre Dame and get a ride to the War Remnants Museum, which focuses on the destruction of the US in the war. We certainly caused a lot of it. We rush over to get very good massages from two very strong ladies. Back to the apartment where we swim with Cori, talk about gender, and head to Bed Nha Luv Tinh, a restaurant that Cori had recommended. Tofu with seafood, catfish in clay pot, beef with salt, duck skewer with sugar sticky rice, banana cake with coconut cream. We stay up late and talk about books, gender, and melatonin.<br><br>Goodbye to Cori and onto a bus for a tour. We ride with Nam, our guide, and ten other Europeans. There are many other tour groups, each is separated by culture. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Western. We get to the Cu-Chi tunnel area. We learn about tunnel building, strategy, and booby traps. People try getting into a small hole. We are taken to a shooting range where you can try firing an M-16 into a dirt hill. Many do. The climax of the tour is getting the chance to crawl through 100 meters of genuine Viet-Cong tunnel. I do. Lots of driving and then we are in Mekong. We have a big, many coursed lunch, which is better than I expected it to be. Now to a boat. The river is brown. This is right where the tiger scene happened in Apocalypse Now. It is very cloudy but there is no rain. We are turned away from a fishing village. We continue on the river and head towards a coconut candy factory where we taste and buy that. We ride a tuk-tuk through narrow concrete streets until we arrive at a performance area where a local group sings traditional Vietnamese songs and If You're Happy. I dip a piece of fruit into sugar and take a bite. It isn't sugar, it is salt. Liz was watching me and is cracking up now. Nam brings out a python and we hold it. On a small boat down where an old woman paddles us down a narrow Creek for a few minutes. Once we're out they fire up the engines and zip away. I chat with a Dutch father on the long ride back to town. At the airport. I gorge in the lounge. We arrive to Da Nang and a nice driver takes us to our hotel in Hoi An.	10.776029, 106.705160	Aug 24, 2019	Aug 27, 2019		Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang		10.776029, 106.705160	10.969431, 106.497128	10.344805, 106.364799											https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6
Sydney	Once in a Lifetime	233	x	I wake up to a beautiful view of Hyde Park and St. Mary's Cathedral. To the posh art deco lounge for a nice breakfast where I have a mishap with a tight french press plunger and spray hot, pulpy coffee over the table and Liz. She is very cool about it. Sydney is chilly and I didn't bring any warm stuff. We do some shopping in Uniqlo and then take a bus south to White Rabbit to see Hot Blood, a collection of interesting and disturbing art from China and Taiwan. We drink some overpriced blue milk from Two Sis. No luck with massages. We relax in the hotel for a bit. I meditate then we head up to the bar and get Aperol spritzes and snacks. From there we walk to Since I Left You where we order Little Grace: Zubrowka vodka, apple, elderflower, spice, whites; Guilty Pleasure: cognac, Pimm's, cacao, bitters, spice; Chile con frijoles toasty. Next onto PS40 and for a Day of the Dead: Chartreuse, maraschino, mezcal, egg, mole; Into the Wild: macadamia washed vodka, verjus, salt baked pineapple, basil. A three-minute walk and we're at Uncle Ming's. We're not feeling the vibe here so we leave before ordering. Instead we make our way to Frankie's Pizza, which has a much better vibe. We order slices of good good pizza, drink some good beer, and listen to a local band play.<br><br>We meet Sok outside a station where. She drives us up to the Blue Mountains for a day of exploration. We check out the Three Sisters and hike around there just a bit. Into Katoomba. We attempt a seemingly Hobbit-themed restaurant, but we don't feel like waiting for an hour to get in so we opt for a fippy chippy. Next to Wentworth Falls for some more mini hiking, bird spotting, and fall viewing. We stop by a cute street town to wander for a few and then head back to Sydney. Sok drops us off and we make for Earls Juke Joint in New Town for some delicious local sour ales. From there we walk a few doors down to Lentils as Anything for a pay-as-you-can vegan Dahl and a coconut soup. A little further on to Jacoby's Tiki Bar, which is a charming Twin Peaks homage (with a Black Lodge hallway) and boasts delicious drinks.<br><br>We take our time at the hotel and I eventually get the wifi working on my laptop. To Cross Cafe for white bean & kale soup, caramelized cauliflower and kimchi toastie, miso pumpkin, and some PS40 sodas. It is very good. Liz goes back to the hotel to work and I pick up some new ear studs from a nice piercing shop. I watch some old men play giant chess in the park before coming back and meditating. We drink and snack in the hotel lounge then cuddle for a little bit before I leave to catch my flight. I get a free katsu chicken sandwich meal with my priority pass and sleep for most of the flight.	-33.713105, 150.310943	Aug 2, 2019	Aug 5, 2019	Sok	Fiji, Sydney	2	-17.934460, 177.260068	-33.713105, 150.310943												https://photos.app.goo.gl/oepkcQ6q48zzMSGk9
Fiji	Once in a Lifetime	232	x	We eat T's Tantan vegan ramen at Narita then fly to Fiji. We watch Fight Club, which we find remarkably relevant. We order a nice chicken with oyster sauce at the Nadi Airport--they missed a golden opportunity by not naming it Nadi by Nature--then get a taxi to the resort. We meet some nice humans along the way. We wait in the lobby area for a what feels like too long while they get the room ready. We attempt to play chess on a board with no pawns. We try to play pool, but there are too few balls and the nets had big holes in them. Into the room and we lie down a bit. We wake up at around 5pm and head to the pool; there are no towels so we walk around a bit. We sit in the lounge for some decent cocktails. We find a hot tub so we do that for a bit. Back to the room where we order a cheese pizza and drink a bottle of bubbles. Nice times are had by all.<br><br>Buffet breakfast. The steamed buns in cardamom coconut milk are yummy and texturally very non-Western. We play chess on a giant board where each square is as long as my foot and the queen's crown comes up to the ticklish part of my thigh. I beat Liz, but give her some helpful tips. We head to the pool where we swim as far as the swim-up bar. We dry off in the sun, read about the formation of stars, drink more bubbles, order a pepperoni pizza, and chat with Mom & Jim. They give us a whirlwind tour of their cruise in the North Sea, their road trip around the Midwest, and Danny's memorial service in Middletown, CA. We just miss the sunset. To the infinity pool and more hot tub. We get smart looking and arrive at the fish restaurant apparently too close to closing because we get glares from the kitchen staff. We receive some quite good (hopefully clean) food including coconut civiche, tuna poke, seared salmon filet, and cauliflower soup. We play another game of big chess; this time in the moonlight. I win, though not as easily as before.<br><br>Buffet again for mostly coconut stuff and fries. Someone forgot to put custard in the custard donut. We receive a wildly inflated hotel bill and have to sort that out. We relax and read a bit. Kay #2 then takes us to the airport to pick up our rental car...which they didn't have. In fact, they didn't have any cars. The sweet woman tries to sort it out and manages to find an eight passenger van for us, but by now Liz and I have decided we are done with Fiji and that we'd rather spend the rest of our time somewhere else in the world. We book some tickets to Sydney and, after dealing with some very mediocre customer service, demonstrate exemplary hedonism in the well-stocked lounge; probably our favorite part of Fiji. We get on a flight. I exhibit inhuman restraint by not taking the penne Bolognese with shaved Parmesan or the Hagen Das single serve ice cream cup. We get a ride to a very nice hotel and sleep.	-17.934460, 177.260068	Jul 30, 2019	Aug 2, 2019		Fiji, Sydney	1	-17.934460, 177.260068	-33.713105, 150.310943												https://photos.app.goo.gl/oepkcQ6q48zzMSGk9
Naoshima	Art Island	231	x	On the train to the airport we see a middle-aged Japanese woman wearing a backpack with pot leaves all over it. We're pretty sure she doesn't know they are pot leaves. We get vegan sushi and also a beef rice block at the airport then catch a bus and then a ferry to get us to Naoshima. First we check out the big red pumpkin then have some long, chewy udon. We check into our hotel and fall asleep for a few hours. We get a nice latte and miss a bus so we grab a taxi to the Honmura port and where we get tickets for Art House, a collection of empty homes in the area which have been made into art exhibits. #1 Ishibashi for waterfalls and burnt cliffs. #2 Haisha for statue of liberty and laquer room. We stop by 'The Water' to dip our feet in a nice pool. #3 Gokaisho for flower petals on tatami. #4 Kadoya for LED numbers in water. We walk to Go'o shrine for white rocks, an underground chamber, and ice stairs coming up from the underground pool, through the ground, and up the shrine. To the bubble bike parking lot and then on a bus to Benesse House Museum for some more nice art and looking at the sky. Our favorite piece here is a wall of phrases like 'play and die' and 'fuck and live' written in neon. WE get another cab and find it's our same drive from earlier (apparently there are only two taxis on the island). We make for Naoshima I <3 Yu public bath, but get distracted by a cute mid-century Americana diner with a great smelling grill out front so we have some Cajun chicken and a tuna melt first. Into I <3 Yu for a nice bath with a big elephant sculpture. We see Buddy from the diner and chat with him for a while. It turns out he's good friends with Elovis Sato! Next we walk to Bar Saru for a local rice beer and a local ginger beer, which are weird and pretty good. To our tatami room for cuddles and bed.<br><br>Nice coffees from Mikazukishoten. Our barista is very friendly and gives us some stickers. We bus to Honmura and get tickets for James Turrell's Minamidera, which is a very dark room where you sit still for 15 minutes and perceive your eyes adjusting to the soft 'light screen'. It is incredible. We pop into a glass ball mini gallery. Bus down to the Chichu Museum. We wait a while and drink an olive soda, which tastes like Sour Punch rope. Into Chichu: The James Turrell pieces are profound. We do Open Field twice. Monet's lillies are poetic and De Maria's ball is heavy. Down to Lee Ufan for some serious minimalism and then another bus to Miyanora. A ferry and then a train to central Okayama. To The Coffee Bar for coffee, nice ginger ale, and a partially frozen creme brulee. We relax in the hotel a bit before heading out. We walk to the river and look at the beautiful black castle. We both get real sweaty. We want to try the local style of udon and walk for a while to a place only to find it is closed for the night. We find another that looks good and eat there. I order one with spicy miso and Liz a cold one with beef, quail egg, gobo, and fried fish stick. It is all delicious. The udon is firm, chewy, and long. Next we get real sleepy and go to bed.	34.458938, 133.996997	Jul 20, 2019	Jul 21, 2019		Naoshima, Okayama															https://photos.app.goo.gl/Q95uNkVW9w8vGdpm8
Taipei	Come Again?	230		We land at the close airport and take a bus to our hotel. Rest a bit plus nice times. We walk to a very good boba stand for an oolong with taro, milk, and boba. Then we take a bus up north to Shilin Market. It is quite bustling. We rediscover the basil and egg pancakes we loved last time and get one. After a bit we smell a stinky tofu stand and see a long line for it. Needless to say we hop in. The tofu is fried in cubes with a crispy outside and a spongy center, which perfectly sops up the funky cabbage, sweet sauce, and spicy paste in the bag. It is fantastic; even weirded and better than we'd hoped. We stroll a bit more and then head back to the hotel. Nap a bit more and then to Draft Land for drinks. All of the cocktails are on tap; we order a South Island Fizz: Kaffir gin, falernum, lime, mangosteen mats soda; English Milk Punch: brandy, dark rum, cinnamon, apple, sugar, lime. Next round is Special: chili, rum, vinegar, whey and Hop Heads: IPA, oolong vodka, sherry, and a round of truffle fries. All are delicious and cheap. Next we walk to Bar Mood for purple potatoes, pork spare ribs, Sweet Osmanthus Blossom: Bulleit Rye, Osmanthus syrup, Carpano Dry, lemon, egg white, smoked plum and Tyrant's Blessing: mezcal, tea syrup, basil & lemongrass syrup, lemon, grapefruit, basil. Walk back.<br><br>A morning chat with Liz's family for a bit then we head to Starbucks for caffeine. We ride a bus to Yongkang and ete at our favorite soup dumpling restaurant. We order a bunch of soup dumplings plus cooked green onions, a pork roll, onion black pepper buns, and black sesame buns. Everything is incredible. Up to the contemporary art museum for some contemporary art. Back to the hotel for a shower and then across the street for massages. Mine is painful and awesome. Next we walk to Indulge for chicken consomme, chicken liver pate, romanesco stir fry, and pork. They accidentally bring us the wrong pork (which is not very good), and they are out of the one we wanted so we get chicken wings instead (which were also not very good). For drinks we sip Imperial Honeydew Cocktail: imperial honeydew tea liquor, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, cherry, spice and Lingering Autumn: rum, Osmanthus, autumn plants, shiso. Second round is Dream Big: bourbon, sour mash, Mandarin Napoleon, amaranto, black walnut, bay leaf. Grain in Ear: tequila, mango, agave, lime, orange blossom, charcoal roasted oolong beer foam. We go back to the hotel to 'lie down for just a few' before heading out to the next bar...there will be no next bar.<br><br>We do some Father's Day chatting with dads and get more massages. Liz has her feet massaged and I do cupping, which is weird, painful, and oddly relieving. Onto Toasteria for halumi with pesto, hummus, and a grilled cheese with lemon caper aioli. It is very good. Next to Huashan 1914 Creative Park. We drink a black sugar boba latte and wander around for a bit before heading to the airport.	25.044254, 121.529428	Jun 15, 2019	Jun 17, 2019																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/6rjmwKLtML1fbJhC6
Kyoto	It’s Always Sunny In	229	x	We make the first flight of the day, which is awesome and unexpected. We land and take some trains for a while. We arrive at Karasuma station at around 11 and are able to check into our apartment early...which means we nap for a while. At 1 we head to Hale, a vegetarian restaurant in Nishiki Market, for a yuba mushroom don set with many wonderful sides of tofu and veggies and a fermented fruit spritzer. Next to Sou Sou where we pick up a nice black and white tenugi. We walk by a shop with nice leg designs and bought matching shirts. Onto Fushimi station and to Vermilion for an Orangina and espresso drink. Into a moderately busy Fushimi Inari. Liz wants to do the whole hike. We find some charming shrines, a few friendly nekos, a sulfur cured egg, and superlative kitsune figures. We ride the train to Face House, which is a house that looks like a face and then walk to Sake Bar Yoramu, which is a small bar that serves exclusively rare and unconventional sakes. The owner is very knowledgeable and helps us to appreciate some very interesting sakes; one of which had been aged in the bottle for twenty-two years and tastes to me like a moldy french cheese. We walk home and sleep for a long time.<br><br>A lazy morning with conbini coffee and a flan crepe. We walk to Weekenders Coffee for a dark roast and a light roast cold brew. Both are excellent. Bus ride to Aonigiri, which it turns out is closed. We find a local beef curry restaurant where we eat a beef curry and a beef hash omurice. Next we begin our many hours-long stroll down the Path of Philosophy. We mostly skip the bigger temples and focus on small finds like a pretty black dragonfly, tako ni neko washi tape, cats, hydrangeas, and a mouse shrine. Back in the city we find a good and cheap antique shop where we pick up a flower vase. Onto Yasaka and then the Geisha district, which is pretty dead. We try going for Mexican food, but it is closed so we head back to the apartment for a bit to relax. We eat way too many gyoza at Chao Chao and try to go to a gin bar, but it is closed. Next we walk to steam-punky L'Escamoteur for a Death in Provence: Absinthe, lavender, lemon, sugar and a Rossi Gin Fizz: Tanqueray, absinthe, vanilla, cream, egg, citrus, sugar. After there have a bit of difficulty finding F.S.N., a bar run by a French guy who plays old Metallica. A man at the bar compliments Liz on her 'deep voice'. The owner is sweet and chats with us for a bit on the patio.<br><br>My tattoo peels and we head to Kiyomizudera. Off the bus and we see a sign for a raclette & coffee shop, so naturally we do that. We order a smoked chicken baguette and fries, each with cheese, and two lattes. We walk up to the temple and explore there a bit. Then we take a bus to the north east side of town where we explore a Daruma temple Liz had found when searching for Daruma temples. It is cool and we buy a Daruma. Back to get our bags and then head to the airport.	34.967170, 135.773265	Jun 8, 2019	Jun 10, 2019																	https://photos.app.goo.gl/QpAgbt24Jwdm6g39A
Part 4	Road Trip NZ	228	x	Remembered Liz's birthday and gave her pack of film in a wrapper with a cute drawing on it. Got on the ferry and got the premium cabin again. Read some book and ate some food. Got off a few hours later in Wellington and hit the road. Grabbed a Macca after a few more hours and got to Whakatane at around 10. Chatted a bit and to bed. <br><br>Juanita was having some car trouble and we soon realized that we would have to take the van, whose name she informed us was Wakka Two Lips (not Tulip) up to Auckland. First we snacked on a yummy pork roast she had made and some pickles. Hit the road and made it up to Auckland in a few hours. Hung in the hotel for just a bit and then headed to Woodpecker, a Texas BBQ Asian grill. We had some delicious food including beer batter fries, frickles, tiger prawn dumplings, tempura eggplant, fermented chicken, and Korean-ish pork ribs. <br><br>Juanita said goodbye. We checked out and walked to Best Ugly Bagels. They were playing Jailbreak when we walked in and a charming man who reminded me of Miguel was shouting along. Had a Humdinger with hummus, tomato, and zaatar. We also had another Boss Hog and two maple iced coffees. It was all so good we then decided to get a King Kong, which featured a tasty caramelized banana whipped shmear and a chewy chocolate bagel. Walked to the hotel. Liz napped a bit and I drew what could be perceived as a figure masturbating to white noise...it was the first time I'd drawn in a while. Watched Dead to Me and drank a bottle of red wine. Took and Uber to mini golf to find it closed. Went instead to a different mini golf, which was right next to the hotel. The theme was military, kiwi (the bird) and dinosaurs. We both played well, but I won by one point. Walked next to Amano for dinner. Stracciatella with fig, shallot, and honeycomb. Crayfish pulsante with garlic, lemon, and dill. Pappardelle with lamb ragu, olive, pangritata. Fell asleep with the lights on. <br><br>Had a nice buffet and Liz headed to work. I hung for a bit and then treated myself to a massage for being a good driver. Found a good looking place nearby and did that. Had a nice woman work my back real good. Picked up another kombucha, which made my grand total for the trip at least a score. Went downtown and stopped by AS, a nice basics store where I bought things only in black. Bought some tickets for that night for two shows as part of the NZ Comedy Fest. Headed up to the room and proceeded to eat coconut Whittaker's and watch BlackkKlansman. Headed to BurgerFuel, which Juanita had recommended, for an American Muscle and a vegan burger. They were quite delicious. Went to Q Theatre next to see James Acaster, who is one of the best comedians I have seen in a while and had a great set. After that we headed directly to the next show (next door) for a trio of Australian comics. Michelle Braiser mixed vocal loops and had a heartfelt piece about wanting to fuck Aladdin. Demi Lardner had dogs for shoes and ate soap. Aaron Chen didn't do any of that funny business, but had plenty of his own. <br><br>Kissed my lady, went to the airport, and got another bagel.	-37.953380, 176.996689	Apr 19, 2019	May 8, 2019	Juanita	Picton, Whakatane, Auckland	4	-41.293945, 174.775733	-37.953380, 176.996689	-36.849648, 174.763762											https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7
Part 3	Road Trip NZ	227	x	We had planned to get up early and hike around Mt. Cook, but the morning was rainy and gray. We opted instead to head to High Country Salmon, a local salmon fishery, for an Eggs Benedict and a bagel, both with salmon. They were quite good. The weather was cloudy and rainy, but we decided to try our luck with Mount Cook anyway. Headed up past the sparkling blue lake and up into the valley. We hung in the car for a while and watched some Twin Peaks. No change in the weather, but we decided to do the hour return hike anyway. It was beautiful and well worth the wet toes. Started to drive back down the mountain and, as we later found out, had our multi-rib belt snap on us. Spent the next few hours figuring out what was wrong. Had some wine and food on the side of the road and slept there for the night. <br><br>Made some 'Tow?' signs for the car, but didn't get any takers. Called Gary, the electrician and mechanic who came and picked up the van. He dropped us off at the backpackers hostel in Twizel and we hung in the lounge for a while to charge up and finish Twin Peaks. Chris, another charming local man, checked us into our room. We did some laundry, showered up, and relaxed for a while. Eventually we headed out to Ministry of Works for dinner. We had a very good burger, and a pizza with chicken, cream cheese, rosemary, apricot, and cashew. I had a nice local pale ale while Liz had first an apple crumble cider and then an apple rhubarb cider, both of which were quite good. <br><br>Checked out. Chris offered to drive us up to High Country Salmon where we started with coffee and a caramel bar and then had salmon nachos and a salmon Thai curry. It was very crowded with tour groups. Walked back to town and found some very good looking mushrooms along the way. Stopped into poppies cafe to warm up a bit and have another coffee. Stayed by the fire quite a while and had a honey banana smoothie. Found out we wouldn't be getting the car today so we booked another night at the hostel and relaxed a bit. Wrote some postcards and picked up groceries. Dinner was yogurt roasted cauliflower with pesto pasta. We were too tired to watch a movie. <br><br>The car was ready around 10:30. We got on the road then and headed through the very beautiful Lindus Pass, which featured golden rolling hills backed by craggy snow-topped mountains. Headed next to lakes Hawea and Wanaka. The glacial color was not as pronounced as it was in the Twizel area lakes, but there were some hints of emerald and jade. Made it to the Cardrona hotel next where we had popcorn squid, frickles, lamb skewers, and garlic bread. Caught sunset hitting a large mountain just as we came into view of the Wakatipu Basin with Queenstown at the far end of it. Had a quick stop in the revamped mining town, Arrowtown, just as the light was fading. Pulled into our camper spot in Queenstown just after dark. Did some grocery shopping and decided to snack and watch Picnic at Hanging Rock rather than venture into town for fish & chips. <br><br>Woke up at 6:00 and walked into town to catch our coach for our Doubtful Sound tour. Drove down Lake Wakatipu and through a very lovely glacial valley. Got off at Manapouri where we took our first boat from one end of the lake to the other. Took another coach through the steep and winding mountains to get to the tip of Doubtful Sound, where we caught our second boat. Cruised through the sound and learned much about the local history, flora, and fauna. Where the sound met the Tazman sea we stopped and said hello to the seal colony. Went back in for a bit and then turned off the engines. The captain made a vague 'no promises' about seeing something special. About a minute later we saw a stirring in the water about 200m away. We began to see fins and before long we had about fifteen bottle nose dolphin friends playing around and under the ship. They showed us their tummies. Finished the boats and did the transportation in reverse. Back in Queenstown we headed to Blue Kanu and had a local IPA and essentially a strawberry pina colada to drink. For food we had pork ribs, black pepper venison, and kung pao duck nachos. Then a ginger colada. Bed bed. <br><br>Nice wake up times. Bought some cold brew concentrate and milk and finished off the delicious cereal. Cleaned up. Walked around the downtown a bit. Liz bought a nice jade necklace for her mum. We took the gondola up the mountain and did a couple of luge rides. Hiked up the Ben Lomond trail for a bit and found some incredible mushrooms. Headed to Erik's Fish & Chips for that. Next off to Fergburger for one of those. Drove for quite a few hours, listened to some great music like Houses of the Holy, Madness, and Les Paul & Mary Ford. Camped out in the same spot outside of Christchurch that we had done about a week prior. <br><br>Sat in the sun and read. It was lovely. A chatty forest ranger and I shot the breeze a while. Back to C1espresso for another lamb empanada, more coconut milk coffees, a cheesy pastry, and a savory muffin with butter. Hit the road and drove a while. Stopped in Kaikoura upon the recommendation of a woman in Queenstown. It was pretty and the beach was very stony. Wandered there a bit, found some very smooth stones, and got back on the road. Got to our campsite just outside of Picton and nabbed the last of twelve spots. Watched The Seventh Victim, an almost shockingly bad and boring film about a satanic cult with supposed homoerotic overtones.	-45.025900, 168.660436	Apr 19, 2019	May 8, 2019		Mt.

Part 2	Road Trip NZ	226	x	Awoke early. Back to Best Ugly where we had a tuna melt and a chicken sandwich; both were stellar. Next we headed to the ferry terminal and took the three-hour ride to Picton, on the south island. Other than the jerk man who lied to me about his 'friends' coming so as to not have to share his seats with us, it was pretty uneventful. Landed and were immediately in awe of how beautiful everything was. It wasn't too dissimilar from the north island, but the mountains were taller and the colors were more autumnal. Started heading south first trough some mountain passes, which had the softest fog lying gently upon them, and then down the coast. After a while we pulled over to check out the beach and snack a bit. We continued our five-hour drive south. It was pretty much non-stop gorgeous. We saw many seals playing on the rocks and in the water as we drove. Liz wanted to stay in a hotel so we did that in Christchurch. Got to our room, did some sink laundry, showered, and headed to dinner at Little High, a hip food stall hall. We had some nice local beers, a vegan burger with coconut bacon, very good chips with aioli/bbq sauce, and a pizza with cauliflower cheese sauce and fried capers. Back and to bed. <br><br>Headed to C1espresso for nice coffee and a lamb empanada. Played some Monster Bash pinball afterward where Liz got a score of 51 million. Drove towards Akaroa and we stunned again by the continuous and ever developing beauty. We stopped by the side of a lake and had some snacks. A big duck greeted us and basically squacked at us until (and past) when we fed it after we were finished eating. A few times it walked on to our towel and we had to shoo it away. Drove up some lovely mountains and Skyped with Liz's parents near the summit. Down the other side and into Akaroa. Parked by French Bay and Skyped with Mom and Jim. Explored the cute, very French influenced, town for a bit. Began driving up a very steep and very beautiful mountain toward the outer coast, but soon there was signage warning against camper vans from taking that route. We stayed at the top of the hill, which overlooked Akaroa, and caught an incredible sunset. Drove back to Christchurch and went back to Little High for dinner. We had a roasted broccoli from Bacon Brothers plus a spicy pepperoni pizza and a huge poutine from the pizza place. Everything was delicious. Drove to a campground just outside of the city and called it a night. <br><br>Began driving towards Mt Sunday, a.k.a. Edoras. All went well until about 20km from the site we came upon a very bumpy gravel road. We decided to continue through it, but I was a bit worried about the van falling apart. The entire area was basically Rohan, with rolling golden hills near to us and craggy snowy peaks in the distance. Made it to the parking lot for the hike, which was almost 2km each way. We we're in awe at the beauty throughout the hike. The water we had to walk through at a few points looked as though it has just melted off of a glacier. We hiked the quaint mountain; I was surprised at how small the summit was. You could hardly fit a single hall at the top let alone a whole town. It was windy and certainly looked like it belonged in a film. I left my sunglasses at the top. On accident. Began the longish drive to Late Taroko. We pulled up to the lake just after the sun dipped below the mountains, but we had about a half an hour to walk around and appreciate the views of the lake and mountains. From there we headed to the campground near the bottom of lake Pukaki. We parked the van, got out, looked up to the sky and we were both immediately in awe at how clear the stars were. The Milky Way was clearly visible and the entire sky was full of twinkling dots. We took some silly long exposure shots. Then we had some red wine with bread, cheese, and pate. Read for a bit and then tucked in.	-43.535178, 172.640786	Apr 19, 2019	May 8, 2019		Wellington, Christchurch, Mt.

Part 1	Road Trip NZ	225	x	Massage chair after landing took my money and didn't work, which resulted in the opposite of a massage. Found someone to pay me back and got it done right. Bus to Manukau where we ate Indian food in a mall. Finished the ride to Rotorua and picked up the van. Dusted off the spider webs and did some practice driving around the neighborhood a bit. It went well so we headed to Warehouse and Countdown to stock up on supplies. Then we got gas, tidied up a bit and headed to dinner. Liz found Atticus Finch, where we ate roasted cauliflower with Dahl, coconut yogurt, & coriander; roasted greens, cashew cream, preserved lemon, quinoa & cumin crisps; lamb rump, veggies, tapenade, & feta creme. Parked on the street neat Lake Rotorua and settled in for the night. It was a bit chilly, but we slept well. <br><br>Got up and went to Epicurian downtown for some coffee. Bought a sourdough baguette and some incredible cheese from a passionate Italian man from the farmers market. Drove around the lake and found a nice grassy spot for a picnic. Liz napped a bit and I read. Got to Waitomo and did the Glowworm Cave tour. It was only about an hour long, but the cave was wondrous and the worms, which are actually fungus gnat larvae, were very mesmerizing. Checked into to our camping spot for the night and relaxed a bit. Headed back to the caves for the Ruakuri Cave tour. There were only four of us plus the guide, Demi, who was very cool and informative. She was happy to let me take all the long exposure shots my heart desired; well, a reasonable amount anyway. We wandered through an expansive and stunning cave system for about two hours. We found more worms, pupa, and a fly. We met tubers. We saw some stunning limestone formations. Demi mentioned a nearby bushwalk that was great at night so after the tour finished we checked that out. Saw more glowworms, a loud waterfall, and some scary spiders. Came back to the hostel and made a dinner of beans & fried egg on toast, ramen noodles with Piri Piri tuna, the rest of our farmers market cheese, and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Showered and worked on computers for a bit before heading to bed. The temperature was perfect and the drizzle of the rain made for a lovely sleep. <br><br>Had some muesli with milk and hit the road. It was a day of much driving and a good bit of rain too. Had a Macca lunch and, eight hours or so after beginning our drive, we pulled into Wellington. Went downtown and ate dinner at Chow, a mostly vegetarian, pan-Asian restaurant, where we had some nice, though unremarkable, small plates. Headed to a marina parking lot/camp site and settled in. Watched some twin peaks. <br><br>Headed back downtown and got Best Ugly Bagels. Maple syrup iced coffee, poppy with cheese, and bacon, cheddar, egg, rocket sauce on sesame. Walked to Leeds Street Bakery to pick up some sourdough and have a salted caramel cookie. It was rainy out so we headed into Milk Crate and had an iced coffee. Got a parking ticket. Back to Milk Crate and had a hot ginger drink. Wandered the downtown area some more and killed time looking in a bookshop and a record store. We were planning on going to get tacos for lunch, but when we arrived we were not feeling enticed. We were, however, feeling quite enticed by the Malaysian pace right next door. We ordered some satay, a veggie curry, and the most incredible roti bread I've ever tasted. It was lightly salty and also sweet. It was hot and chewy, while being just a bit crispy too. Headed to Miramar peninsula for the Weta tour, which included a miniatures tour for the new Thunderbirds Are Go television show and also the Weta Cave tour, which gave a glimpse into the variety of work that Weta does. It was quite cool, though less LOTR focused than I was hoping for. We drove along the coast through the evening fog until we reached the airport. We did not have a flight, but we were hoping to see the Gollum statue in the terminal. Inside we learned that they had taken it down, but we did see Smaug's head and Gandalf riding on Gwaihir. Next we stopped at a grocery store to pick up hummus, cheese, and salami for dinner. We first parked in the same camper lot as the prior night, but I became nervous about getting a fine—we were not technically eligible to stay in that lot. As we left we saw a park ranger who I am pretty sure was checking vehicles. We tried parking along the side of the road, but it turned out to be quite a busy road and was a bit scary. In the end, we tried our luck back at the camper park and ate and slept in the car.	-41.293945, 174.775733	Apr 19, 2019	May 8, 2019		Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo, Wellington	1	-37.006683, 174.784614	-38.145085, 176.248911	-38.267987, 175.078463	-41.293945, 174.775733										https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7
Seoul	Second	224	x	Took a cab to the hotel and slept for a while. We were feeling uninspired and were about to eat tacos, but at the last moment we passed by a dak galbi place and opted for that. We had good kimchi, nice soup, a big tray of dak galbi with cheese and various types of rice cake, fried rice and soju. Then we headed to Alice, where we drank barley water. Amuse bouche: white wine, orange, hibiscus. Reflection: .cacao nib scotch, lapsang tincture, amaro vermouth. Teddy Picker: banana rum, cold brew, Sherry. Next door basically to Le Chamber. Hello Seoul: soju, burnt rice, egg white, cinnamon. The Botanist: Gin, butterfly pea syrup, lavender, lemon, egg white. Bed.<br><br>Had a hotel breakfast and relaxed a while. Took a bus towards Insadon, but it changed directions and we got off in a different area. Fortunately, we were right by Gwangjang market and went inside. Ate a pork pancake. Went in a restaurant where we drank Chestnut beer and had. Walked around that area a bit and got a saltef butter caramel shake from Shake Shack. Took a bus back to Gamgnam and headed to Keeper for I ____ it: Ardbeg, passion fruit, lavender, agave. Marscapone Gin Fizz: gin, cheese powder, vanilla, double cream. He also gave us a White Rabbit (named by Liz): kombucha, carrot juice, white whiskey, birch syrup. Also they gave us 'girl drink' shots on the house for posing in an Instagram photo for them. Home and Twin Peaks.<br><br>Breakfast and Twin Peaks. Changed hotels. Walked by City Hall and down the canal street until we hit Insadong. Egg cornbread. Bugolgi pretzel roll. Wandered the street and were left a bit uninspired. Tried to find good coffee, but settled on Starbucks. Took a bus to the Charles H bar. Old Crawford Punch: Jamaican rum, Cuban rum, mango, house chai, Curry leaves, clarified milk. Midnight Zombie: Caribbean rum, Genever, Calvados, passion fruit, cinnamon, lemon, dry sherry, absinthe. Headed back to the hotel and met Manav and Kartik for happy hour. Tried to find the fish stew alley, but apparently it was closed on Mondays. We did find a nice street stall where we had some rice cakes, veggie gyoza, and a chicken/onion skewer. Walked some more and came upon a fried chicken alley. Picked a place and had fried dried fish, a seafood pancake, good fried chicken and beer. The boys called it a night and we went to Marque D'Amour. The space was well designed and featured many peacock busts that blended into the ceiling decor. First we had a sweet welcome drink. Then a Soft Rain: Cocchi Americano, sherry, lime, patchouli. Dark Flowers: Diplomatico, sherry, fernet, melon. Both were quite good. From chatting to our bartender we learned he was very good at flare bartending, but that he wasn't allowed to do it here. We asked him what types of flare drinks were common he made us something called a peach crush. As we were paying, he also made us all shots of whiskey sours. Lastly, they gave us two tickets to a Picasso exhibit at a local museum. Being nice to people has its perks.<br><br>Had breakfast with Liz and then she went to work. I had trouble getting my computer online. I headed out to the market again and found the fish stew alley. After an involved process of picking all of the tiny bones out I was able to enjoy the lovely and spicy dish. Took a bus to the museum. The Cubism exhibit was pretty cool, though not very large—I was through the whole thing in a little over 20 min. Took a while getting back to the hotel, but made it in time for lounge happy hour drinks and dinner. Met Liz and her colleagues out at a chicken and beer place for Tom's going away do. It was a lot of fun and lifted my spirits after a day of some waiting and frustration. <br><br>Got up early and flew home.	37.526207, 127.041115	Mar 9, 2019	Mar 13, 2019																	
Takaragawa	Onsen Weekend	223	x	For a Valentine's getaway we thought we'd treat ourselves to a weekend in the onsen resort of Takaragawa. On Saturday, we awoke early, had a bit of trouble getting our JR Passes, and barely caught our train to Gunma. Made it there and then caught the ryokan shuttle bus for a winding, 45-minute drive through the mountains to the resort. Checked in and hung in our lovely room. Napped for a bit and then headed to the indoor onsen to wash. After that we walked the outdoor path to the main onsens, which were outside. There was snow all over the ground and it was actively snowing. After a couple of minutes we arrived at the onsen area, which consisted of three large pools all sat along the river. We went into the first pool. For as cold as it was outisde (about -3C), once we were in the toasty spring water we felt amazing. The pool could have easily held over 200 people, but probably only had about 20 at the moment. The outdoor pools were mixed gender. The women were all given 'bathing dresses' while the men feigned modesty by holding small towels over their appendages when they got up to walk. It began snowing more heavily, but we stayed in for quite a while to take in the view. Eventually, we heade back to the room and watched some Charlie Chaplin videos. I gave Liz some very nice chocolate I had bought the previous day in Tokyo. At 6pm we went to the ryokan restaurant for our kaiseki dinner where we were served pickles, sashimi, shrimp, tofu, salted river fish, tori nabe, broccoli & mushroom cream soup, umeboshi with apricot, and fresh fruit with whipped cream. Though it was still quite early, we were both so wiped after dinner that we went straight to bed. <br><br>Awoke and had a decent buffet breakfast. Spent the day combining snacking on chocolate and red wine, touching, watching Twin Peaks, eating ice cream, and hanging in the onsen (both indoor and outdoor). At 6pm we again went to the kaiseki restaurant for a similar meal, with slight variations in meats and preparations. This time we had mackrel, a beef nabe, and salmon sashimi. All were incredible. Finished twin peaks and slept for a bit. At around 9:30 we headed back out to the onsen (they are 24hr) for a dip in the dark. It was wonderful and we stayed out there for about an hour. <br><br>Breakfast again and checked out early to catch the bus back into town. A woman sitting behind Liz on the bus became sick and, fortunately, had a bag handy. When we got off Liz also got sick. Though it was cold and we were tired we still decided to head to Takasaki as it was on the way back and free as part of our JR pass. We did so to visit Shōrinzan Daruma-ji Temple, which is home to Daruama dolls. We visited the temple and saw many, many darumas. We bought ourselves a mid-sized white one, which makes our current collection three. From there we headed home where I made a nice dinner of fermented tomato water shrimp with a dessert of fermented banana, marscapone, and manuka honey filo wraps. It was a beautiful weekend.	36.846597, 139.047628	Feb 9, 2019	Feb 11, 2019		Takaragawa, Takasaki	1	36.846597, 139.047628	36.329816, 138.957278												https://photos.app.goo.gl/6fyxcKr47fiZ3jfGA
Hakone	Revisiting	222	x	Played with fermented bananas and took our time getting to the Odakyu line. Stopped in Odawara to check out the castle. As we were walking to the castle a nice woman started chatting with us and invited us to a prayer ceremony. We politely declined and proceeded to check out the castle. Headed back to the station where we picked up some pork & shrimp dumplings and a few maki. Took a switch-backing train the rest of the way into town. Headed straight to the Hakone Open Air Museum, which we explored for a few hours. We love many of the pieces, the layout of the park, and especially the Picasso museum! Took the train one more stop to Gora and checked into the lovely Hakone Tent, which is a charming hostel/hotel. Took a dip in the private cedar onsen which felt very nice and was quite hot. Had a fruit tea in the kitchen then started walking to the brewery. On the way we saw a meowing cat in front of a conbini. We bought a can of cat food to give it, but right as we opened the can a cat grandma walked by and said hi to the cat; they proceeded to walk off together. We continued walking with the open can of food and after a minute came upon another meowing cat who seemed to appreciate the unexpected dinner. Got to the posh restaurant/brewery, had some beers with grilled shishito, crispy rice, and aburi salmon. Came back to the hotel. Had some hot sake and a great miso cream pizza. To nice Japanese women sat at our table and we chatted for a bit. Back to the room for some nice times and sleep.<br><br>Hit the onsen again, had a nice breakfast where we chatted with a French woman, and had more nice times again. Took the cable car up the mountain and then the ropeway back down. Took some very nice pictures of Fuji and got on the boat. Read some Princess Bride and got off at Motohakone. Waited a while for some yummy pastries and walked along the water. Took a bus to Hakone Yumoto. Wandered around there and bough some local citrus chu-hais. Back in Odawara, we were immediately approached by three women who seemed very interested in what we were about to do. When we said we were just heading to the grocery store, they immediately lost interest. That, couple with our prior experience with the overly kind woman led us to search online and discover that Odawara is home to a particularly aggressive sect of Buddhism. We avoided them and bought some nice veggies and a steak to take home.

Singapore	Back to SIN	221	x	Made a midnight standby flight from Haneda. Watched the Lego Batman movie on the plane and ate a potato omelette. Got a Grab to the Four Points and got early check in because of Liz's platinum status. Slept, made a French press, and hung a bit. Got a ride to Atlas, a very incredible bar in one of the most stunning buildings we've ever seen. It is done in an elaborate art deco style and is referred to by locals as 'The Batman Building'.

We drank a Nude On a Terrace: Venezuelan dark rum, Italian bittersweet liqueur, citrus, agave, hibiscus. Louis Cartier: Genever, apple cider reduction, dill vermouth, lemon, gold.

Watched 2001: A Space Odyssey in the room. Finished a month old sandwich. Lazed a bit and then headed to Dapper. Had some nice cold coffees and read Harlan Ellison. Next to Amoy St hawker market. First we had prawn mee, a spicy dry noodle dish with prawn and crackling. Next we had fried kway teow, which, as far as we can tell was basically a delicious clam and sausage pad see eew.

On the way we passed a building where about 30 rats had made a playground in-between a wall and decorative grate which gave the viewer a similar effect as looking at an ant farm, but for rats. The wall was a well-lighted facade feature of a posh building, which made the event especially entertaining for Liz and I. A security guard came by to see why the two of us were so enthralled with this wall and also found the need to document the experience.<br><br>Chatted with Mom for a bit and had a big buffet breakfast. Checked out at 2pm and headed to the National Museum of Singapore for a Polaroid exhibit and a quick walk through the history museum. Headed to Operation Dagger where Ash treated us to a smoked banana kombucha and a taste of the Not a Margarita: pea husk, smoked agave, passion fruit vinegar, salty fingers.

Taipei	New Places	220	x	Made it to Taipei uneventfully and headed for lunch at Din Tai Fung. We had two types of soup dumplings, a BBQ pork dish, and red tea that we're all quite good. Checked into our apartment and hung for a good while. Eventually we headed out for dinner and drinks at R&D Cocktail Lab where we ate sweet potato fries dipped in truffle cheese sauce and savory fried chicken. For drinks we had Search for Pleasure (cynar, punt y mes, lemon, orange bitters); a Hibiscus Fizz, a Hot Buttered Rum, and a hojicha Old Fashioned.<br><br>I grabbed coffee, red dragon fruit, and some pastries from the market before we hopped on the bus towards Jiufen. Got there. Wandered through adorable, crowded streets. Almost had a pot of tea, but for >$20, we thought better of it. Snacked on grilled eringi, Taiwanese sausage, tofu, and ice cream mochi. Back to town and to Yongkang Beef Noodles for the eponymous dish, which was nice and underwhelming. We were about to call it an early night, but we happened to be near Alchemy, so we went in for a drink. Milk Punch: cognac, dark rum, milk, vanilla, Angostura. Heart of Aztec: tequila, pineapple, cacao, honey, lime juice, brulee lavender buds.<br><br>Up early for a bus and train ride to Hualien. Tried our luck at finding a scooter rental place that would rent to us (most only rent to locals) and got one on our third try. It was perfect weather. We drove through town, then along a highway - with it's own scooter lane - and into Taroko Gorge. We spent a few hours cruising up into the mountains, checking out temples, and taking in the unreal sizes, shapes, and colors. Made it back into town right before sunset and caught a train back to Taipei. Liz had to work a bit so we hung at a Starbucks and then at a Mos Burger, where we had a rice bun wagyu burger. Hit the Raohe night market near Songshan and then got a ride to Ounce. Sensation: gin, marashino, lime, mint. 1864: mezcal, vermouth, aperol, campari, mole bitters, orange.<br><br>I picked up a persimmon and some delicious cherry tomatoes for breakfast. We were very lazy and took a long time to get moving. We checked out of that and into a new hotel. There we relaxed some more. We eventually headed down to Yongkang Street again and went to Jin Ji Yuan. We had a yummy pork roll, which was reminiscent of an English sausage roll. Then we had pork soup dumplings and another kind which had a shrimp on top. It was all incredible and quite cheap. We walked south and wandered around Shida night market before heading up to Smoothie House for a sugar overload in the form of a mountain of shaved ice topped with raspberry, strawberry, mango, and strawberry ice cream. It also came with a side of custard. We opted for a quiet night in and a movie, though we ended up just falling asleep.<br><br>Another lazy morning of coffee and tomatoes. Moved to a new hotel and went to Woo for lunch and cocktails. Food was a bacon cheeseburger and Buffalo wings with dill sour cream. Drinks were Fancy 75: Tanqueray, Pavan, grapes, lychee puree, lemon juice, sparkling wine. Figgy Fizz: housemade fig bourbon, honey, teapot bitters, Thai tea soda. To Ximen. Walked a bit.

Wandered around Zhongshan and stumbled across a Mikeller location. We had an incredible local sour ale and a saison/lambic blend with s broccoli salad. To the airport.	25.039181, 121.544820	Dec 18, 2018	Dec 23, 2018		Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taipei, Jiufen, Taroko Gorge	2	25.039181, 121.544820	25.109359, 121.845433	25.039181, 121.544820	24.172280, 121.560821										https://photos.app.goo.gl/mPTJG9QysUuUB2Qw9
Kaohsiung	New Places	219	x	Cut a yoga mat short to bring it along. I have been working out and feeling good about my body. I want to keep doing that, but I also want to eat a bunch of good food. Let's see if I can manage both. <br><br>To Rueifong night market for dumplings, brown sugar boba milk, shrimp yaki, an addicting ring bottle game, watermelon milk, and a salted pork bun.<br><br>Lazy morning with French tarts and cold brew. Taro chunks in green tea. Temples on the lake. Into a dragon's mouth, out of a tiger's. Chalupa-like bread, egg, cabbage, and sweet chili sauce. More temples. Sweet, spicy, sticky roasted corn. Uber to Pier 2. Pretty sculptures and cosplay people were abound. Pet some cats and had Gong Cha boba (brown sugar pearl latte). To the food market for incredible garlic lobster, dark sauce and onion scallops, and salted grilled shrimp. Bought some massage tools. Back at the hotel we ate Pringles, drank beer, and gave massages.<br><br>Had some weird breakfast in the hotel. A woman was playing a bluesy, repetitive version of Fly Me to the Moon. Took a train to Tainan, had a boba sugar milk, and checked into our tree house hotel. Hung there a while and then headed out to explore the town. Found a place that specialized in a rice porridge with pork and shiitake. There we also had a nice dumpling soup and pork with sauteed greens. Wandered some very charming streets and found many cats, great architecture, ornate temples, and interesting street art. Headed towards Shennong Street when we passed a cafe that had many cats inside. We went in, played with some cats, had a huge rose milk tea and a creamy boba toast. They also treated us to an incredible crème brûlée cheesecake. Down Shennong where I bought a nice vegan leather wallet then headed back to the hotel for a bit. Headed to The Checkered Record Club. There was a wait so we headed to a small food stalls serving incredible danzai (noodles in broth with ground pork, shrimp, and a brown egg). Back to TCRC for a tequila, orange juice, and elderflower drink for Liz and a mezcal, umeshu, pineapple, and black pepper drink for me. Back to the hotel where Liz had a long night of work. <br><br>Liz had a work call so I wandered the city a bit in search of a danbing (tortilla egg wrap). Found an awesome one at a market right next to the hotel and brought them back for Liz. Cleaned up then headed to the station to catch a high-speed train to Taipei. I ate a yummy egg-sand from Family Mart.	22.619056, 120.285098	Dec 15, 2018	Dec 18, 2018		Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taipei, Jiufen, Taroko Gorge	1	22.619056, 120.285098	22.999734, 120.203988												https://photos.app.goo.gl/mPTJG9QysUuUB2Qw9
Nagasaki	Unexpected	218	x	We were meant to fly to Kyoto, but with about sixty standby passengers ahead of us, we opted for a better bet and caught a flight to Nagasaki. We ate a delicious beef curry pan on the plane while I read of troubles in Bree. Checked into a not-too-smoky room. Slept a while. Woke up and walked to Inasayama where we took a ropeway to the top and enjoyed a magical sunset follow by pretty glittering lights. Walked back to town and took the trolley downtown. Had a bad Singapore Sling in a charming antiquated CD (music) bar. Wandered and found a cool looking tiny bar with an eyeball on the door, but we're turned away by the trans probable racist tender. Went to a sushi place that looked nice. A lovely man and woman at the counter translated for us that we would need to wait about twenty minutes. About six minutes later they came out and apologized for taking so long, then gave us their seats and also bought us possibly the best chutoro we've ever had. On top of that we had some incredible ika, ebi, tamago, uni, aburi saba, anago, and local sake. We enjoyed it so much Liz recommend we book reservations to come back again the next night so we did. <br><br> Headed to NGS Coffee for a delicious iced chestnut latte and a hot chestnut hojicha latte. We were a bit disappointed to find our tour boat would not land on Gunkanjima because of typhoon damage, but we did the cruise anyway (as they wouldn't give us a refund). It was pretty awesome to see. Went through Glover Garden and saw a church. We had a short rest in the hotel and then took a train to Konagaicho; a small town that has fruit shaped bus stops. Saw a few of them until it got dark and took the train back to the sushi restaurant. Had a whole bunch of lovely sushi. A weird older man came in and left before too long. A sweet Japanese couple bought us an akadashi miso soup. We chatted with them a bit and, before we parted, they invited us to join them for breakfast the next morning. <br><br> Got picked up by Satoshi and Ikuko. They drove us to the port fish market for a stellar and very reasonably priced kaisendon breakfast. They dropped us off at the Peace Park where there were many tourists. We then walked to the hypocenter park where we heard school children singing to the monolith. Next to the Atonic Bomb Museum. Had another chestnut coffee from NGS Coffee then headed downtown to wander, look for neko-ni-takos, and look at a pretty bridge. At a pork bun and some delicious soup dumplings. Headed back to the bus terminal and caught one to the airport.	32.741237, 129.876682	Nov 17, 2018	Nov 19, 2018			1	32.628578, 129.737196	32.741237, 129.876682	32.821223, 129.767522											https://photos.app.goo.gl/pjXCjZydBGhg8eVY9
Kanazawa	A Weekend in	217	x	Took a bus into town. Had a dark chocolate apple Frappuccino and watched children trick or treating while enrolling in health insurance. Went to a gorilla themed curry restaurant and ate with forks, which was weird. Took a crowded bus to Kenrokuen - a big beautiful garden - and looked at the lovely things for a good while. Walked over to the geisha district and chatted with some Americans on the way. Saw a very cool art deco building mixed in with the geisha houses. Headed back to the hotel and grabbed some conbini food on the way. We both fell immediately asleep. Later I checked out the onsen where I sat outside (on the roof of a 14 story building) in a very hot pool and let the rain drizzle on me. It was nice. <br><br>Watched some Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and ate melted ice cream. Went to the museum, but they wouldn't let us take bags in so we said fuck it and went to a shrine where we bought some more inari statues. Next we walked through the castle and told each other how much we love each other. Headed through Oyamajinja, which had a lovely Dutch gate. We we're uninspired by the food options so we had a Princess frappuccino and another pork & mushroom sandwich from Starbucks. And headed back to the airport. We couldn't get on the first flight and had about an hour to kill so we sneakily drank sake, ate french fries, and watched more Sabrina. We are 16 year old girls from the 90's, apparently.	36.562025, 136.662339	Oct 27, 2018	Oct 28, 2018			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/YVT54QFMRPoLRChY9
Seoul	Meating in Korea	216	x	Up early and made the flight. Liz got business and had some nice food. I had egg salad on a hot dog bun and watched part of Blade Runner 2049. Landed and took an hour long can ride into the city for $20. Checked into our hotel. We were both wiped so we napped for an hour. We were still wiped so we kept sleeping a while. Got up and went to the metro station. Took the train to Hongdae. It was a cute, lively area with interesting architecture, lots of restaurants, and many people out on the street. It felt like a much larger version of Cat Street in Harajuku. In many ways, Seoul immediately felt like a more laid back version of Tokyo. That being said, we found ourselves using the work 'brusk' often when describing interactions with the locals. We went into a beauty shop and bought many face masks and also foot masks. Walked on a bit and had nice chicken skewers from a street stall. On one street watched people play a carnival style balloon dart game, some teenage kids practicing their dance moves, and people doing street karaoke. More beauty shops, brutalist architecture, and Danish mid-century furniture. Stopped into a grill restaurant for pork tripe with belly meat and a strong, smooth soju. Then we headed to Bar d.still where I had a BCG (beet, cherry, grape) that was nice, though a little flat. Liz had a Wild Style with gin, lemon, egg white, and Galliano. Took a cheap cab back. <br><br> Took our time getting up. Ate a nice buffet breakfast. Watched some End of the F***ing World. Chatted with Scott for a few. Moved to the posh Plaza hotel after watching some Mongolian singers. They upgraded us to a very nice room. Went to the club and had some snacks. Walked through some palace grounds and visited a modern & contemporary art museum. There were some nice pieces and we mostly preferred the abstract stuff. Bought some more face masks and headed south to Maple Tree House for grapefruit soju, and Korean BBQ including: miso, kimchi, pork jowl, marinated pork collar, and a nice beef striploin. Took a bus back and went to bed. <br><br> Had breakfast in the club lounge. Hung out in the hotel for a while while Liz prepped for her meeting later in the day. We met Yeo Kwang in the lobby. He was so sweet and seemed genuinely so happy to see us. We headed to a great chicken soup restaurant where we spent the next hour catching up. The food was great, though I lost my appetite slightly when an old woman sat down beind us and proceeded to make disgusting snorting and spitting sounds for the next thirty minutes. I later asked Yeo Kwang if that was a normal behavior and he said it was definitely not! We said goodbye to Liz, grabbed a coffee, and headed towards Gyeongbokgung, the ancient royal palace. We spent a while wandering the grounds, he taught me a bit about Korean hihstory, and we discussed music therapy ideas. I saw him off and began heading back to the hotel, when I notice I was right next to the Korean Contemporary History Museum. I went in and spent the next hour and a half learning about the past 150 years in this peninsula. It was pouring when I left, but I really wanted to see the comfort women statue outside the Japan Embassy so I walked over to that. There was a guard watching the statue, to presumably discourage vandalism. I bought a few tops from Uniqlo, picked up some snacks for later, and headed back to the hotel. I quickly went up to the club for happy hour where I had some nice vegetable lasagne and taught the attendants how to make a Negroni. Liz surprised me after a few and we snacked and drank some more together. We headed back and she immediately fell asleep. <br><br> I worked on my video game for a while. Then I drank a bottle of soju and looked at abstract art. I convinced a reluctant cab driver to take me to a mediocre burger restaurant. Next I took a bus back downtown to get my bag and meet my Liz. After a quick stop in the airport club for a drink and some snacks we caught a flight and I finished Blade Runner 2049.	37.565900, 126.973693	Sep 1, 2018	Sep 4, 2018	Yeo Kwang		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/BZJkce6VeZEdAdar5
Ishigaki	Hot Beef Island	215	x	Made a standby flight just in time to avoid the typhoon that was about to hit Tokyo. Landed and caught a bus to Ishigaki City. To the hotel and relaxed for a bit. Got up, ate a delicious burger from a stand down the street that is connected to a yakiniku restaurant, and headed to the port to catch a bus to a beach. We met a lovely, sassy woman at the info counter who informed us that it was way too late in the day to try to catch a bus to the beach and also that Ishigaki is renowned for the beef from the cattle raised there. She recommended we visit the island's oldest temple and a nearby garden, which we then did. The temple was old and the garden was serene, from the front at least. We then walked to the cute town shopping area where Liz got a pineapple popsicle and a drunk man asked me some questions. Came upon a live music and dance performance, which we watched for a few. Then we relaxed in the hotel and watched some OITNB. At one point I went to Family Mart to get a taco rice maki, Pringles, and some very delicious pineapple-shikuwasa beer.<br><br>Took our time getting up the next morning. Had some chanpuru and Blue Seal ice cream for breakfast. Checked out and caught a local bus up to Kabira Bay. Walked down to the beach. The water varied in shades from deep blue, to seafoam green, to emerald. There were a few glass-bottom boats docked along the beach which were regularly ferrying people to a nearby reef. We walked down the beach for a few minutes and found a shady spot under a steep bank. We stayed there for a few hours while we slept, read, explored the sea life, and I got sunburnt. We saw hundreds of hermit crabs, some sea cucumbers, snails, pretty blue fish, and a big starfish. Headed back up to a restaurant where we had a beef croquette, a soba dish, a beer, and then a soft serve. Wandered around the park area and then stopped by a local awamori distillery where we picked up a bottle. Caught the bus down to Fusaki Beach, which we had to walk through a resort to arrive at. The water was protected by nets and lifeguards because of the many jellyfish that live in the waters. We swam in the warm, salty undulations and lay on the beach until the sun dipped below the clouds for the evening. We then took a bus back into town, checked into our new hotel, and took showers. Walked down to Ishigaki cattle Maru, where we had some local yakiniku, hot-stone bibimbap, and sours. We had picked up some more of the pineapple-shikuwasa beers and were planning on watching more OITNB, but we were both so tired we came back and fell immediately asleep.<br><br>Woke up ten and half hours later. Had some coffee, Spam onigiri, and beers and watched an episode. Checked out and took a bus to the ANA resort hotel beach. It was quite hot and neither of us were really feeling this beach, which had many kids running around, so we caught another bus a little while later and hung at the airport instead. We ate a Spam-don and one last goya chanpuru before catching a flight back to Tokyo, where we had quite conveniently missed out on the typhoon.	24.338284, 124.157782	Jul 28, 2018	Jul 30, 2018			1														
Osaka	Pachinko and Prostitutes	214	x	For some reason I didn't take notes on this trip. I can tell you we had more yakiniku, though we were less impressed with it now that we've had a lot more good yakiniku. America Mura was better this time and we had some nice coffee there. We discovered a great shop called Village Vanguard. It was reminiscent of a Spencers. We definitely saw some Chinese prostitutes. We had a nice time strolling along the river. We visited the National Museum of Art and learned about a few new Japanese artists. I listened to a wonderful street performer who sounded like a one man Sigur Ros. We actually tried Pachinko. It was very difficult to understand, our machines kept beeping and giving us error messages, and people kept trying to help us even though we were helpless. We spent ¥2,000 and it was all over in a little more than ten minutes. I don't need to do that again.	34.691760, 135.491932	Jun 2, 2018	Jun 3, 2018			1														
Hạ Long Bay	Vietnam	212	x	Picked up early and took the long ride to the port for Bai Tu Long Bay. Went through some art and pearl shopping stops on the way. On the boat and into the bay. Took some nice photos and time lapse shots. The boat parked. Small boat to kayaking, swimming, and beach area. It was a very small beach that had a lot of people on it and was quite littered. They were very strict about exactly where we could kayak, which was only the route from the pickup area to the beach. Back to boat for tea, relaxing, and dinner. Many nice Vietnamese dishes. Liz completed a Vietnamese wood puzzle and we unsuccessfully tried squid fishing.<br><br>It was a rainy morning. We, as a group, decided to skip early kayaking for more time exploring the bay. Switched to the day boat. Played Vietnamese cards inside as we headed towards the floating fishing village. The village was a an area on the water protected by steep rocks on all sides. We switched to a bamboo row boat and explored the nearly deserted village. It was quiet, drizzly, and serene. Under an natural rock arch and then back to the day boat. Lunch with nice fried pork rolls. New folks on the big boat and the same kayaking beach trip as the prior day. Drank tea with a nice sunset. Ate a many course dinner. Sim (a 20-ish local woman who worked on the boat) was very charming and very committed to making karaoke happen. We finally got someone's phone to connect to the PA and I sang All Star to a few Australian families and the Vietnamese crew. It was a bit odd, but there was nothing else to do on the boat so people seemed content to keep it going. Some of the kids braved the crowd and sang a few songs I didn't know.

Okinawa	Southern Japan	206	x	Monorail to downtown. Naha feels a bit like Hawaii, Tokyo, and Miami mixed together. Walked to a food stall lot. To the pork shop, Umibudo, for Tonkotsu ramen, pork cakes, and beers. Walked to the street market. Bought black sugar Pretz. Visited a few shops. Went in salt shop where we tasted many salts and sprinkled many salts on soft serve. Napped. Liz had a headache. I drank Awamori with David in the hotel reception. Out. The taco shop was closed. But we found another Mexican place, which ended up being perfect — Borrachos. The staff had tattoos and we had margaritas, chips and salsa, shrimp quesadilla, goat tacos, taco rice, and a chicken quesadilla. Met a kind ojiisan, a well known local musician, and a news anchor. We we're tasting very hot sauce straight. I poured out too much on a plate. The musician proceed to take the plate around the restaurant and feed the very hot sauce to anyone who would accept, which was pretty much everyone. People were hilarious and had very over the top Japanese reactions. Eventually the kitchen staff came out and confiscated the hot sauce plate from him probably due to fears of the many health code violations being broken. We were all drunk.<br><br>Woke up still drunk. To the ferry that would take us to Tokashiki. Though it was a large boat the sea was rough and it rocked heavily throughout the journey. Got to the island and we rented a car. We drove by a mass suicide site. There was a plaque detailing the absolutely devastating suicides of entire families who huddled around grenades and strangled themselves with torn cloth in fear of what the American soldiers would do to them when they invaded. We cruised the island and found an observation spot. We peered through some unfocused binoculars. We then fad taco rice and a karaage bowl and saw many cats in a small town. To the beach.

At 3am Liz and I decided to head back, but David wanted to stay up and go and meet the people whose voices we were hearing across the bay. He hung out with them for a while and then got lost coming back and took 2.5 hrs to find the hotel. <br><br>Up very late, 4pm late. To a cute island. Ate some soft serve. Found a dead fugu on the beach. Watched a pretty sunset. To Heart Rock just as it got dark. Back to the hotel. They fell asleep at 8. At midnight I ordered Dominos for everyone and we watched some Ugly Delicious about pizza.<br><br>Slept past the hotel breakfast time so we ate at Family Mart. Down to the central part of the island. To a fish market for lunch. Then to some very old castle ruins. To Ikea island. There were hard waves and the water was chilly so we took a nap on the beach. To a cute vintage car motel.

Provo	Holi	201	x	Drove up from Antelope Canyon with Sean and Anthony. We arrived as the party was going on. We made sure to wear white. Got hit in the face with a bunch of color immediately. Picked up some powder of our own and spent the next hour or so appreciating the coming of spring by sharing beautiful colors with lots of people who were mostly not Indian. Someone had tagged the llama, I am not sure if that was an okay thing to do or not. By the end nothing was white except the mountains. I wiped my face on a nice man's shirt. On our drive back down we spent some time in Arches National Park and made some grotesque gestures.	40.075772, -111.679617	Mar 26, 2011	Mar 26, 2011	Sean & Anthony	Antelope Canyon, Provo	2	36.861907, -111.391838	40.075772, -111.679617												https://photos.app.goo.gl/qxcKKvyNjMDbJHwv9

Kyoto	Kyoto Colors	185	x	Waited at Haneda for much of the day not getting on flights. Finally made one and got in late. Not much was open. Found a gastro pub and had nice beers, pizza, and caramelized onions. Got to Arashiyama too late. The lady from the hostel gave me a hard time. <br><br>It was an utterly beautiful morning. Enjoyed Arashiyama for a few hours. Did a nice shrine with many colorful trees, a pond, and a garden right off the main street. Down to the water for unreal sights and colors. Eventually headed to Inari station. I didn't do that shrine, but went for a nice cortado nearby and met some lovely Australian women. Walked up to Tofukuji with loads of people and many areas to explore. Bought a tiny plate and took loads of incredible photos. Caught the sunset only through the lights in the leaves. To Osaka.

To Speak Low for Christmas eggnog, hot buttered rum, absinthe, clarified milk punch, lotus chips, and a spicy tuna roll. Next to Constellation Bar for a hanky panky and a silk stockings.

Lastly to Union Trading Company for a parmesan foam clarified milk punch and truffle fondue fries. Dumb cabs would not stop for us so we walked home.	31.214848, 121.465899	Nov 17, 2017	Nov 17, 2017		Male, Maafushi, Villingili, Shanghai	2	4.251114, 73.546206	31.214848, 121.465899												https://photos.app.goo.gl/sacHNha2iPTba4dX2
Chiang Mai	Thailand	183	x	To the hotel. They give us a floating lantern gift to palace in the river. They also drive us into the madness that is downton. So many people and so many lanterns! We bring two and set them off in the middle of the fun. From there we walk down to the river river and set off our floaters. Some people just a little ways down stream are collecting them. Wander. We attempt a Mexican restaurant, but it closed early. Instead we find a street food area with many carts. We get great satay, pad see ew and banana chocolate roti. To bed. <br><br>Nice fruit muesli. I work for a bit. Back to the Mexican restaurant for cold brew, tacos and quesadilla. Next to the town center. We get massages and walk to the street night market. I buy Barb a singing bowl. At a food cart area we eat a massive and incredible bowl of Tom Yum for a couple of bucks. The guy was about to close up for the night so he puts in a bunch of extra jumbo prawns and scallops. It is the best Tom Yum of my life.<br><br>We are picked up by the elephant bus for elephant day. To the elephant conservatory for OLIPHANTS...I mean elephants. They have six I think and they are all adorable. First we feed them buckets of sugarcane. We were able to pet them and even touch their tongues while feeding them. Next we take them on a walk up through the woods where they eat so many trees. We walk right alongside the. There are moments I feel I may get trampled. They make us a nice massaman curry lunch at the building. Now we walk the elephants to the river. I am not paying attention and I rammed a rusty piece of barbed wire into the side of my calf. Liz gets in the river and plays with them, but I stay out to hopefully avoide some type of nasty infection. The animals are very playful. The smaller ones are jumping on each other. Back to the city and then the airport.	18.788081, 98.987924	Nov 3, 2017	Nov 5, 2017		Bangkok, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai	3	13.723138, 100.518473	19.905911, 99.831065	18.788081, 98.987924											https://photos.app.goo.gl/q6A8AlnESrdWpCSj2
Chiang Rai	Thailand	182	x	We get a cab to our b&b. It is cute, but warm and Liz is not feeling well. I go to Heaven Burger and bring back great burgers. I work a bit. Out. We have a fresh strawberry milkshake and wander the night market. I buy linen pants. To a pool (sticks, not trunks) bar. There is an older white guy DJing by blasting house music videos on Youtube. Every couple of minutes he seems to get bored with the current track and cuts it short. Some older local ladies periodically give him lap dances. One grinds on Liz for a bit. We play another round of pool though because it and the beer are super cheap.<br><br>Gross toast with margarine. To the bus station and on a bus to white temple. It is surreal and seems like a satire of religion. There is a huge mural on one wall about the creation of the Earth. Darth Vader and Pikachu are both present. Local people are praying inside. Nice pork, satay and pad Thai. Back to bus station. Apparently all the busses to Chiang Mai are fully booked. We decide to find a few other tourists who have also been left behind and we all rent a 'taxi' together. The taxi is a pickup truck with an open camper shell on the back with bench seats 8 of us sit in. It is fun and scary and dusty. We pick up a bunch of weird snacks and drink warm beer as our driver blasts like a madman to get us to the city.	19.905911, 99.831065	Nov 2, 2017	Nov 3, 2017		Bangkok, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai	2	13.723138, 100.518473	19.905911, 99.831065	18.788081, 98.987924											https://photos.app.goo.gl/q6A8AlnESrdWpCSj2
Bangkok	Thailand	181	x	Our first stop is Chinatown. At a food cart we order something unidentifiable, but delicious. To the Mandarin Oriental. They roll out a red carpet...though not on our behalf. Mama Oldest Restaurant for westerner friendly street food.<br><br>Really good breakfast buffet. Next we catch a boat ride to the "floating market", which is not actually floating. There are massive lizards along river. We get a bunch of nice big shrimp and satay. To Sirocco rooftop bar for nice drinks and a cool view with Kate, Simon, Mark and Michael. Dinner is at Blue Elephant: Tom Kha, scallops, foie gras. I get pretty bad stomach cramps, but only for about an hour.<br><br>Mall shopping. Tuk tuk drivers try ripping me off on my way back, I ride on the back of a guy's motorcycle for much less money. It is scary as shit though.<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Gaggan</span><span class="list__item">Thai G&T</span><span class="list__item">Charred eggplant oreo-like sandwich</span><span class="list__item">Tom yum sorbet</span><span class="list__item">Yogurt spoon</span><span class="list__item">Black ball</span><span class="list__item">Banana leaf fish fillet</span><span class="list__item">Goat brain tart</span><span class="list__item">Fake matcha service</span></span>I spend the day out with Michael (the other tag along partner).

Siem Reap	Cambodia	180	x	A very nice check-in guy checks us in. To a nice room then to Footsteps Cafe for Amok Lap Lok (an incredible fish curry), a banana smoothie, and coffee. Next to Hard Rock Cafe for Dad gift and then a long tuk tuk ride to Angkor Wat Putt, an Angkor Wat themed mini golf course a man built it on his property. There are miniature replicas of many of the famous temples. He plays Jeff Beck while we drink beers. Liz gets a hole-in-one on the most difficult hole. It starts pouring and we meet some kind gaijin teachers. After our game we head back to the city. To Mama Shop for great pizza and burrata. Next to the night market for some tight pants.<br><br>Hotel breakfast. The servers are oppressively over attentive. We rent bikes and ride to the Angkor Wat ticket office. We buy tickets, but it is very hot and Liz is already feeling the heat exhaustion. We return to the hotel, sleep a while, and then meet Dara, a tuk tuk driver who would become our go to guy from then on out. To a family restaurant for Lol Lak, spring rolls, fish soup, a banana shake, and coffee with condensed milk. They have a cute cat. To the old market for pants and a scarf. Tuk tuk back. We relax and bit and get massages in the hotel room. Liz sleeps and I go out for dinner. I find the area with the best looking food carts and pick up fried rice and grilled chicken. Brought some back to Liz and we watch Moone Boy.<br><br>Breakfast fried rice. Dara picks us up and we commenced our Angkor tour. First to Angkor Wat. We spend a good while exploring the large and beautiful complex. Through the bridge tunnel. Monkeys and pigs. To Angkor Thom. We eat at a touristy restaurant with great food. Coconut shakes, 'spicy' sour fish soup, and pineapple chicken stir fry. To Bayon, an enchanting temple with many head statues. Liz still isn't feeling well so we take a break for a little bit. Next to Preah Khan which had two moats and a very cool tree growing up through a two story building. Liz is all done. Tuk tuk back. She thows up in a park and then feels a bit better. Hotel sleeps. I go solo to Marum for a young coconut lime shake, a red ant beef kafir stir fry, and a tea smoked chicken dish with chinese broccoli.<br><br>Dara picks us up at 5 a.m. To Angkor Wat for the sunrise. It is beautiful, but overall too cloudy for much of a sunrise. Sweet coffees and eggs with bacon & cheese at a place Dara takes us to. Next to Ta Prohm (a.k.a. the 'Tomb Raider' temple). Then to Banteay Kdei where we were hit with a sudden rain. Back to the hotel. We shower and get nice ribs and a fish paste and pork 'dip' at Viroth's. Dara picks us up again and takes us to Kampong Phluk floating village. It is quite pricey and our 'tour' boat was driven by a 12-year-old boy. We pass a pretty village. He pulls over and we were told to get off the boat. We are then told to pay more for a different boat (a rowboat through the mangroves we would soon find out). It may have been nice, but we aren't expecting any of this sudden change and are already unhappy about paying so much for the initial tickets so we say no and got back on the first boat. It is weird and we feel pretty uncomfortable. By the mangroves and then to a big lake. We sit there for a few min still on the water and then went back. We can't find Dara at first. When we do we complain a bit to him and he seems to feel quite bad. To Bakong, our final temple. He buys us a coconut to apologize for the bad time we had. We are very grateful and had a nice time after that. We walked around the temple for a while. The imps are adorable. They follow Liz around and have fun scaring me. There is lovely live music coming from the monastery next to the temple. Back in tuk to hotel. We pee and head to the airport.	13.426192, 103.859557	Oct 11, 2017	Oct 15, 2017		Phnom Penh, Sihanouk, Siem Reap	3	11.565077, 104.932512	10.606478, 103.521259	13.426192, 103.859557											https://photos.app.goo.gl/oAltPZBprdyyPjEq1
Sihanouk	Cambodia	179		To Deluxx Hotel which is located in an alley, but we get a nice room. It is hot so we relax and order room service of very nice sausages and potato gratin. After a nice touch we head downtown. They are going for a party beach vibe here, but there are hardly any people around so it feels a bit sad. Falafel, pita, and tahini.<br><br>Pancakes and omelette at the hotel. We are very slow to do anything as it is very hot out. We finally get a tuk tuk to Otres beach where we sit on some nice chairs on in the shade on the water. We order a pizza and something like a Pina Colada. The water is warm. Another tuk tuk to the lion fountain and then dinner at Dao Vegan for a sweet potato kidney bean burger, cashew cheese nachos, watermelon lime juice, and a pineapple ginger passion fruit juice. Afterward we wander slowly back to the hotel.<br><br>After breakfast we fly to Siem Reap.	10.606478, 103.521259	Oct 9, 2017	Oct 11, 2017		Phnom Penh, Sihanouk, Siem Reap	2	11.565077, 104.932512	10.606478, 103.521259	13.426192, 103.859557											https://photos.app.goo.gl/oAltPZBprdyyPjEq1
Phnom Penh	Cambodia	178	x	We wake up with hangover from the previous night's karaoke jam with Liz, Kyle, & Eric and take a train to Narita. We eat chicken beans, watch Baby Driver, and make it to Cambodia. Our Uber driver picks us up in a Lexus. Taxi drivers yell at our Uber driver for being an Uber driver. There are many Lexus SUVs on the streets. To our nice hotel with many plants and a small pond. The give us a sweet lime drink and we have a mediocre dinner there. After dinner we wander the main park & quay and watch kids play soccer barefoot on concrete with a plastic toy ball. A girl is skateboarding around the square barefoot. Take a tuk tuk back.<br><br>It is pouring when we get up. After a nice breakfast in hotel we take a tuk tuk to the Killing Fields. Our guide points out a palm tree with sharp fronds—which was used to saw people's necks open—many mass graves, and the 'baby tree', which babies were beat to death against. There is a tower of skulls. We drink a cold coconut, meet a nice man named Joel and take a tuk tuk back. To Friends Cafe, a cafe staffed by young people who are or were homeless, for baba ganoush, leek fritters, a delicious chicken dish, and a yummy fresh fruit smoothie. To the Royal Palace to see cats and some pretty buildings. Back to hotel where we realx and enjoy the pool. We drink a tea float and find a staple in the calamari. Massages. Ouch, they are intense. Pizza and ice cream for dinner.<br><br>Early up. Breakfast. Bus station. Long scary bus ride. Gaijin price sweet potato chips. Yummy banana rice tamale.	11.565077, 104.932512	Oct 7, 2017	Oct 9, 2017		Phnom Penh, Sihanouk, Siem Reap	1	11.565077, 104.932512	10.606478, 103.521259	13.426192, 103.859557											https://photos.app.goo.gl/oAltPZBprdyyPjEq1
Jakarta	Casino & Temples	177	x	To a European style gastro pub for nice cocktails, truffle mac, and a fantastic steak frites. Our Uber driver stops to ask locals for directions five times. Our destination is one of the biggest landmarks in the city—the Jogjakarta equivalent of central park. Liz finds a playful cat...and then a lot more cats. We have a hard time finding the exit. A cheeky young boy takes a sneaky picture of us. I take one back.	-6.175470, 106.827118	Sep 23, 2017	Sep 23, 2017		Auckland, Perth, Bali, Yogyakarta, Jakarta	5	-36.840858, 174.756841	-31.962737, 115.836242	-8.509985, 115.263234	-7.607895, 110.203730	-6.175470, 106.827118									https://photos.app.goo.gl/mqx9jrRjDLWKeRVs1
Yogyakarta	Casino & Temples	176	x	Our airplane is delayed getting in. We take a car to our very luxurious hotel. There is about $100 in yen missing from my backpack that I'm guessing a baggage handler stole. Earlier today I lost the painting in Ubud, so I'm not feeling very good about myself right now. I meditate. This is part of the impetus for me later taking the ten-day meditation course.<br><br>The hotel has a big buffet featuring many local dishes. I eat Gudeg, which is very good and is made from young unripe jackfruit stewed for several hours with palm sugar and coconut milk plus lots of spices. We swim in the Laura Croft-esque pool and relax in the lounge for a while. We head into town an attempt a puppet show, but they are closed for a holiday. We head to an outdoor square where there music performers are doing their thing. I buy a colorful shirt. Back at the hotel, a very cool band plays Radiohead to apparently nobody. We hang out for a few songs and they seem appreciative.<br><br>Another great hotel breakfast. We take an Uber to Candi Borobudur, a very cool and unique Buddhist temple complex. On our way out we get caught in the seemingly endless Ikea mall of an exit. We then take a long cab ride to Candi Prambanan, another very beautiful and unique temple complex. We enjoy our time there as sun sets. A couple of ladies decide to take a photo with Liz. Afterward we eat chicken soup (which I later regret) and a cold coconut. Uber back to the hotel. Liz has headache and lays down. I hang in lounge and read a bit.<br><br>We wake up early and head to the airport. We snack on fries and tempeh and, after some long delays, fly to Jakarta.	-7.607895, 110.203730	Sep 20, 2017	Sep 23, 2017		Auckland, Perth, Bali, Yogyakarta, Jakarta	4	-36.840858, 174.756841	-31.962737, 115.836242	-8.509985, 115.263234	-7.607895, 110.203730	-6.175470, 106.827118									https://photos.app.goo.gl/mqx9jrRjDLWKeRVs1
Ubud	Casino & Temples	175	x	There are some very pushy taxi drivers at the airport. We get an Uber to Ubud and check into our B&B.<br><br>They serve us rice and a banana pancake breakfast. The shower floods. We explor downtown Ubud, buy kombucha and cashews, and lunch at Batan Waru for fiddleheads with coconut, tofu curry, and vegetable spring rolls. More wandering and then coconut ice cream. To the market for sarong shopping and then Fresh Spa for reflexology. In the evening we attend a gamelan performance. It is quite polished, the music is incredible, the dancers eye and finger movements are incredibly intricate and I am completely enamoured. Satay from a nice restaurant across the street for dinner.<br><br>Cold muddy coffee. I rent a scooter. They don't ask for ID. I test drive and maybe pass a wedding. Then Liz hops on and we hit the road. We pass some pretty rice patties. A lovely pushy woman gets us to buy postcards. We stop at a roadside stand an snack on corn fritters, coconut water and chicken curry. We walk through more pretty rice patties for a bit and then drive north to Tirta Empul. Many tourists are bathing in the water which we had read is quite contaminated. Next to Goa Gajah, the elephant cave temple. We see a large spider. We get a fresh coconut from a man with a big machete and met a sweet older man with red teeth. I think many people here chew something that turns their teeth red. After we are stuck in traffic for a while we make for a waterfall. A cat and puppy are play-fighting in the parking lot. Back to Ubud and to Batan Waru for tofu, dumplings, and calamari. We also eat coconut ice cream again and then called it a night.<br><br>The scooter was so fun yesterday we decide to rent it again. We eat delicious food from a local woman on the side of the road. To Tanah Lot where we walk the beach and 'cleansed' (in their words) ourselves at the temple. We cruise back, shower and get massages. To another Gamelan performance. This one isn't as polished as the first one, but there are some phenomenal costumes and the music is top notch. Dinner iss a large platter of local foods and a great turmeric drink.<br><br>Banana pancakes. I buy a painting from a man who ran a gas pump. We got facials. I then lose the painting and spend the next hour retracing my steps looking for it. My guess is it fell out of my bag and someone quickly picked it up. We get coffee and I am sad for a little while.

Perth	Casino & Temples	174	x	We arrive at our very posh casino/hotel. Liz is here for a work conference, so I spend a lot of time on my own. First I wander the casino, though I'm not really in a mood to gamble. I get Kung Pao Chicken from a casino restaurant.<br><br>I head to downtown Perth and get coffee and salmon bagel from La Veen. Next to King's Park where I take a bushwalk botanical gardens tour. The flowers are perfect and the Bush has a very unmanicured feel in the best way possible. To Toastface Grillah for okay grilled cheese. Then I buy groceries and head back to the hotel.<br><br>A lazy day in hotel. I snack in the room and hang by the pool for a while. Liz attends a black tie — or green velvet in her case — event. Dinner is a falafel 'burger' in the casino. Still wasn't feeling gambling.<br><br>After a nice touch we go to La Veen again for coffee and sandwich. King's Park bush and botanical with Liz. Lot 20 for fries & gnocchi. A bit of casino fun together and then to the airport.	-31.962737, 115.836242	Sep 13, 2017	Sep 16, 2017	Kate	Auckland, Perth, Bali, Yogyakarta, Jakarta	2	-36.840858, 174.756841	-31.962737, 115.836242	-8.509985, 115.263234	-7.607895, 110.203730	-6.175470, 106.827118									https://photos.app.goo.gl/mqx9jrRjDLWKeRVs1

Twin Peaks.<br><br>Breakfast is Best Ugly Bagels for ugly and delicious bagels. To Mt. Eden and where we explore craters. A terrible Uber driver takes a long time to pick us up. He drive by us on a small street at least three times before stopping. To the hotel and then to Blue Breeze for nice tiki drinks and faux polynesian. Giapo for gelato.<br><br>I visit Liz and her colleagues for a firefighter 9/11 memorial ceremony at a tall tower. The firefighters climb up and donw the stairs of the building and then perform a very intense Maori chant/dance. Stale shell tacos for lunch. Vivace for wine and tapas.<br><br>We get up too late for bagels. I shop at Recycle Boutique.

Los Angeles	L.A.ustralia	172	x	Get get first class to LA. Our first stop is Egg Slut for greasy delicious sandwiches. Next we head to Venice Beach. A man is walking down the street bearing a full sized cross...on wheels. Two women are having difficulties using drugs in beach bathroom. I watch a pretty good skateboarder in the bowl try to busk. In get sunburned through my shirt. After looking at some bad art we meet up with Met Mom & Jim. Get get American food with ranch and walk to the Santa Monica Pier. There's the original hot dog on a stick, a sitar player, the end of Route 66. To the hotel for a nap and hang and then to a Texas-style bar for beers and snacks. Airport traffic run success. To Phoenix.	34.007538, -118.499786	Aug 17, 2017	Aug 17, 2017	Mom & Jim	Manilla, Melbourne, Sydney, LA, Phoenix	3	-37.877026, 144.997341	-33.872549, 151.208929	34.007538, -118.499786											https://photos.app.goo.gl/gGfXcWYVobFZVCk28
Sydney	L.A.ustralia	171	x	Liz heads to work. I check into the hotel then go for lunch at Pablo and Rusty's where I eat a grilled halloumi salad with beetroot baba ganoush and a coffee. I wander downtown a bit and then study in the room. When Liz gets back we buy expensive snacks and try to watch Twin Peaks, but the poor internet speed stops us. Dinner is weird cocktails and a delicious Cuban sandwich. Back at the hotel the internet is so bad I can't my job interview.<br><br>Back to Pablo and Rusty's for a dish of mushrooms, miso creamed corn, Koji, and poached eggs and one of pumpkin, poached eggs, potatoes, and cacio e pepe. Coffee. We move hotels. I read and sleep. Get then get soft serve and massages.

Melbourne	L.A.ustralia	170		Liz is already here. I get in and meet her. She is sleepy and a bit sick. We head to Seven Seeds for coffee and pastries then go shopping for cute cardigans and a Frenchie pin.<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Attica</span><span class="list__item">Cook's Leaves</span><span class="list__item">Aged Santa Claus Melon with sugar</span><span class="list__item">Pearl Cooked in Paperbark</span><span class="list__item">Smashed Avo on Toast</span><span class="list__item">Smoked Pork</span><span class="list__item">An Imperfect History of Ripponlea in three tarts</span><span class="list__item">Gazza's Vegemite Pie</span><span class="list__item">Scallop and Wattles</span><span class="list__item">Chewy Carrots</span><span class="list__item">Mutton Shell</span><span class="list__item">Sour Damper</span><span class="list__item">Kangaroo, Wattles, and Waxflower</span><span class="list__item">All Parts of the Pumpkin</span><span class="list__item">Gilled Marron with Desert Lime</span><span class="list__item">Tulips and Jumbuck</span><span class="list__item">Hot Jam Doughnut and Gumbi Gumbi</span><span class="list__item">Camel Milk Ice</span><span class="list__item">Whipped Emu Egg with Quandong</span><span class="list__item">Attica Chef Tales</span></span>To the Hardy Cafe annex for a breakfast of okay baked eggs w/pumpkin & spinach and nice grilled mushroom dish. Our barista is not a nice guy. To a second girl shop and we look at Opal. Next to a mall where we have coffee and a cookie sandwich. To a cocktail bar for baba ganoush and tiki drinks and then to Lee Ho Fook for lamb ribs, chicken crackling, fried tofu, broccoli, fried rice, and dessert. A super sweet couple sitting next to us tells us about a musician they are very fond of called Rodriguez.<br><br>Liz heads to a conference. I stay in for a bit, then head up to market. A nice folk band is playing. An Aboriginal group comes up next and performs did El Condor Pasa. I buy some tight Keds. Back to Seven Seeds for cold brew and a chorizo burger. Then to a downtown mall. An adolescent girl gets pushed by a hidden door in the KitKat shop. She isn't hurt, but acts like a baby and bawls. The employee who had opened the door looks horrified. I tell her what I saw and she seems a bit better. I buy a fancy chambray shirt. To the Everleigh for Cynar, Cocchi Americano, & peach bitters spritz; then some other yummies. Tapas for dinner: anchovy, tin mackerel, coquette, shrimp, quail, vermouth tonic. Home. Nice touching.<br><br>The hotel breakfast is not good. Liz is working again. A maid walks in on me — fortunately I am in a rare state of being presentable. I take a crowded train to Cumulus and eat some lovely roasted cauliflower. I walk across the river and check out the National Gallery of Victoria. A cute docent guy is a bit flirty with me. In a few minutes, an annoying woman starts being rude him. He can't really say anything, but I give her a hard time for squeezing his shoes. Then he gives me a free ticket to the Hokusai exhibit. There are over a hundred of his pieces, including all 36 Fuji prints. Wow, this stuff is incredible. I meet Liz and we go Opal shopping. Next is burgers and too many fries. There's a film festival going on tonight so we take in an experimental shorts compilation, which is pretty weird. Some of them bother my eyes. Some are quite good. We each nearly fall asleep at different points.	-37.877026, 144.997341	Aug 11, 2017	Aug 14, 2017		Manilla, Melbourne, Sydney, LA, Phoenix	1	-37.877026, 144.997341	-33.872549, 151.208929	34.007538, -118.499786											https://photos.app.goo.gl/gGfXcWYVobFZVCk28
Kobe	Kansai	169	x	At the hotel we relax and clean up. Dinner is incredible. Two types of top notch kobe beef, cooked on a griddle. "Melts in your mouth" is the correct phrase. The fat is rich and coats every surface of my mouth. The chef fries the rice in the leftover beef fat. We take a short walk and then to bed.<br><br>Hand drip coffee, souffle pancakes and french toast. We tour a sake brewery & museum. They have kiosk robots who say "our sake is the best sake", but prounce it as in "for goodness sake". McDonalds. We climb the hill to the herb garden, but it is closed. Back to the hostel for bed times.<br><br>It is hot in the morning. We take the ropeway up to the herb garden where we explore the pretty herbs and nice views and have a buffet lunch.	34.679360, 135.176692	Jul 21, 2017	Jul 23, 2017		Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, Kobe	4	34.818027, 135.426666	34.682402, 135.827280	35.004983, 135.757898	34.679360, 135.176692										https://photos.app.goo.gl/bsat1Jl61D33NSyU2
Kyoto	Kansai	168	x	To the hotel for a rest. We bike downtown and then walk through Ponto street, an old Portuguese area. Back on the bikes to Nishiki Market. We find Snoopy mochi and slurp at Ichiran. Garlic breath. In a quaint, charming square we buy matching t-shirts with legs on them and then ride back.<br><br>Up and to Arashiyama. It is sweltering out. Even walking is difficult. We pass through a magical bamboo forest and arrive at the tofu Kaiseki restaurant Liz booked for us. We eat many types of house-made tofu plus a whole bunch of other delicious treats. Down to the water for a surreal view of the river. Small boats pass by. The lush green mountain on the other side of the river looks like it goes up nearly vertical. It creates a surreal, almost fakely perfect backdrop. Conbini dinner.<br><br>We wake and spend hours passing throug endless torii at Fushimi Inari. There are loads of people at first, but as we climb the hill the crowd thins quickly out. Back down on on a train to Expo '70 park to see Tower of the Sun and get very hot again. Onward to Kobe.	35.004983, 135.757898	Jul 19, 2017	Jul 21, 2017		Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, Kobe	3	34.818027, 135.426666	34.682402, 135.827280	35.004983, 135.757898	34.679360, 135.176692										https://photos.app.goo.gl/bsat1Jl61D33NSyU2
Nara	Kansai	167	x	We accidentally pass our stop. Then I accidentally leave my phone on the train. The station attendant informs us that that train will return after ten or so minutes. We wait. When it returns we hop on and find it just in time to jump off at Nara, our intended destination all along. We ride a bus to the big park and buy biscuits to feed to the deer with. There are hundreds of deer in packs all around us. They are cute, they are in our faces, they bow for treats. One is a bit cheeky and bites me in a tender place. To be fair, I was critiquing its bowing technique. To the Daibutsu (giant Buddha statue). Afterward we dine on Nara-style sushi including mackerel, salmon, ayu (a river fish) and miso soup. We drink lots of water. I buy a children's yokai book and then we watch sparrows grab bugs to bring for their hatchlings in a nest. To Lamp Bar for an egg cup drink & a gin drink. We get chatting with a nice British couple who are teaching near Hiroshima. Train ride back to our tiny walk-in-closet-size hotel room.	34.682402, 135.827280	Jul 16, 2017	Jul 16, 2017		Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, Kobe	2	34.818027, 135.426666	34.682402, 135.827280	35.004983, 135.757898	34.679360, 135.176692										https://photos.app.goo.gl/bsat1Jl61D33NSyU2
Osaka	Kansai	166	x	We eat Katsu curry at Haneda. We catch a plane then a bus then we walk in the heat to out hotel. Our toom is tiny and tatami. We cool down. Up and on a train to Nara (*see Nara trip). Back at night.<br><br>We sleep in. Snacks. We pop in a very loud pachinko hall. We try a game, but do not understand what we're meant to do. To Tsutenkaku, a very cute area. We get strawberry shaved ice on the big corner. Next to Okonomiyaki Chitose for excellent yaki, cold beer, lovely humans, and gift erasers. Down a Freemont Street-esque area. Casual karaoke bars are common. They don't look like they have much English support, but they try waving us in anyway. We play a gun game and pushing yen(nies) in an arcade. We find pachinko/pinball like game, but with bouncy balls. We take a rest in the hotel and watch Broad City. To Dotonbori and Hurumaru Yakiniku again for great meat and sake. They are playing some fun, funky Japanese rock. We learn the band is called ULFULS and that they they are from Osaka and were a big deal in the 90's. Late night Donki and then a long walk home.<br><br>We stay in late. To Freemont for Karaage then to Osaka Station. We visit the Snoopy store and wander. Through the gay district. Detour. America Mura is meh. Takoyaki. Back to Dotonbori. More Takoyaki. Sushi Zanmai for dinner.<br><br>We eat a sandwich, spring rolls, and a sweet potato at Osaka Station then take a train to the instant ramen museum. We get to design our own custom instant ramen cups.

Takayama	Melvin & Mountains	165	x	To our Ryokan where we meet our hosts Azami and Keishi. Liz takes a nap. Melvin and I explore around the hotel. We observe bird mating practices and find a nice quiche place. We have some there and bring some back to Liz. We all leave together and wander the town. It is very quaint. The downtown is a nest of narrow streets with wooden buildings. Ths is old Japan. We dinner at Hida Takayama Kyoya. Tofu, hot miso, grilled beef and a good amount of sake. We explore more of the old town in the dark.<br><br>Ryokan breakfast. We buy artisanal miso from the morning market. We rent bicycles and ride through the rain. To the market and the old town. We get incredible local beef on a stick on the street. Liz finds a beautiful hydrangea woodblock print. We all watch swallow hatchlings in the rafters of a shop awning. We relax for a coffee and then get American-style sushi. We bike up the hill to the Folk Museum, but it just closed. Back down to the east side of town. We explore shrines. There is a majestic cemetery hidden on a mountain behind one of them. We ride and explore them until the sky darkens. To a well-populated area with narrow alleys and many small restaurants. We sit down at a grill-your-own-food type restaurant. The grill is not very hot and it takes a long time to cook the food. There are also carnival games in some of the stalls. We throw rubber stars and fire air rifles. We are still hungry so we walk to McDonalds and get burgers. Back to bed.<br><br>Ryokan breakfast. Again to the morning market where we get an egg marshmallow treat plus local milk. To the Hida Folk Museum. We are treated to beautiful views and spend a hours exploring reconstructed historic Japanese homes. Yakisoba for lunch and then the train back to Tokyo.	36.146282, 137.258947	Jun 30, 2017	Jul 2, 2017	Melvin	Osaka, Takayama	2	34.667350, 135.503703	36.146282, 137.258947												https://goo.gl/photos/qqH6R89QiFovGqyd9
Osaka	Melvin & Mountains	164		We arrive at Osaka Station. I get a beef sandwich from a station stall and eat it on the steps. It is incredible. We head to Dotonbori. This town is gritty and funky. It feels like Tokyo's punk younger brother. Many shops have big funny sculptures sticking out of the buildings to advertise their business. To the B&B where we meet Melvin. Back to Dotonbori. We get shochu and whisky at a stall on the street corner. To Sushi Zanmai for a few pieces and then awesome yakiniku & sake from Hurumaru. A girl is flirty with Melvin.<br><br>Up and to bus. Running. Running late. We nearly miss it. To Takayama where we meet Liz.	34.667350, 135.503703	Jun 29, 2017	Jun 30, 2017	Melvin	Osaka, Takayama	1	34.667350, 135.503703	36.146282, 137.258947												https://goo.gl/photos/qqH6R89QiFovGqyd9
Fukuoka	Flowers & Ramen	163	x	We drop our bags at the hotel. To a coffee shop. I forget to pay, but they gently reminded me. We walk the canal street. To a park where some event is underway. A woman is singing on stage and there are many food stalls. We get melon soft serve, squid balls and cheesy bread. An incredible float parade (the cause for the park festival) passes right by us. Dozens of men are holding up large floats and running down the street with them. One float has a pyramid of probably 200 paper lanterns with candles inside. There is a man inside the pyramid whose job it is to literally punch out any lanterns that catch on fire as to not let the whole thing go up in flames. Back to the hotel to relax for a bit and then a very late night ramen in a very late night town. I learn many restaurants are open until 5 a.m.<br><br>Up and transit to Kawachi Fuji Garden to see, among other things, the wisteria flower tunnel. Pastries at the station. I hide sneaky puppy post-it notes all around for Liz to find. Many of the flowers are already dying off, but it is still very beautiful and we have a nice time wandering the gardens. Conveyor belt sushi is oishii. More coffee and then we explore the west part of town. Hotel relax. The park is closed down. To Ichiran for a very porky, very garlicky Tonkotsu ramen in isolation booths.<br><br>French pastry shop for breakfast. We wander a bit more, eat unctuous udon for lunch, relax in a small park and then fly on an airplane.	33.590441, 130.403029	May 13, 2017	May 15, 2017		Fukuoka, Kawachi Fuji Garden	1														https://goo.gl/photos/m4tHHD5TV2EbaGfU9
Singapore	Crab Legs & Selfie Sticks	162	x	We share an Uber pool with a funny driver who talks to himself plus a Dutch lighting artist. To the hotel. We get ice cream sandwiches from the coffee shop next door. We take a bus to a food hall where we dine on juices—sour plum & lime and hibiscus—and a pad thai type crepe roll. Downstairs to Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle (a.k.a. Hawker Chan) for chicken rice and char siew with fat noodles. It's pretty darn good. In Chinatown we gander through street stalls, visit a Hindu temple and drink Tiger. Even at night we're sweating. To the Supertree Grove. They're doing a Star Wars music light show. Some kids are doing scooter tricks. We walk around the waterfront and eat a breaded chicken cutlet from a local stand.<br><br>To the mall part of town for some nice coffee with M.A.D. (macadamia, almond, date) Milk and a sous vide egg & lamb skillet. Back to Chinatown where there's a dumpling festival going on. A wonderful, sassy, colorful woman is M.C.ing. We stumble into the Buddha Tooth Temple, which is dark and exotic. To the Maxwell food market where we get sugarcane juice, fried banana, gyoza, and carrot cake. South of Chinatown through a hip district. Back to the hotel to rest up a bit. To Long Beach Crab. The restaurant has dozens of large tanks with crabs, lobster, fish, and clams. We order the black pepper crab, an aubergine pot with chicken floss and lobster fried rice. It is all incredible and very buttery. To Sugarhall, a rum bar, for great music and nice drinks.<br><br>Same place as the day before for breakfast. To the Gardens by the Bay where we explore the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome for most of the day. To MTR in Little India for a nice vegetarian meal. We walk through the red light district. A line of men is waiting to enter a brothel. Liz flys out. I check into a hostel.<br><br>To Hawker Chan again for char siew and then to Dapper coffee for Magic Gold Brew. I spend many hours in the National Museum where I also eat chicken wings and an ice cream sandwich. As the sun sets I explore Fort Canning Park. I head to Jumbo. I order fried rice, but I'm sitting at a big table with nice Japanese ladies who shared their food with me.	1.284170, 103.865592	May 4, 2017	May 7, 2017		Phoenix, Hong Kong, Singapore	2	22.297690, 114.171517	1.284170, 103.865592												https://goo.gl/photos/XQdZXnxBKKi6pFVw5
Hong Kong	Crab Legs & Selfie Sticks	161	x	We fly from PHX to LAX and meet Ryan for a few in the terminal. They give us first class on our leg to Hong Kong. I eat nice food, watch some Curb Your Enthusiasm and get a good sleep in. We take the train into town. It is early, but our hotel lets us into our room anyway. After a shower and na we head to Hong Kong Station for dim sum at Tim Ho Wan. We get pork buns, rib meat, dumplings, beef balls. The tea tastes a bit like dirt. We head to Victoria Peak. There is a long line for the tram up. It is very crowded at the top and feels like being in a mall. After much waiting we get a pretty nice spot up front. The timing is just right and we watch the sky turn dark and the city turn bright. It is quite beautiful. A girl pushes Liz's head over with her selfie stick. I call her out for it and she seems embarrassed. As we're leaving she apologizes to me and Liz, which I appreciate. Back into the city for a roast goose and sweet pork soup. Next to Honi Honi for some nice drinks.<br><br>We get up and head east to a food market. The first area we check out is mostly raw ingredients, but we soon find the cooked stuff. We split a yummy roast duck. Next we head to a nice coffee shop for cold brew and a smoked milk affogato. The barista is playing with this funny toy think. She tells us it's called a fidget spinner. From there we go to the Ladies Market. I buy a spinner, then immediately get a Baader-Meinhof for them because I realize every tenth person I see is playing with one. We get foot massages. More Ladies Market. I buy a wallet. To Kowloon Park. There is a row of anime statues. I don't know any of them. To a street standing spot for pan-fried soup pork buns. When Liz bites into her first one the hot juice squirts right up her nose and burns her bad. It hurts for a few days afterward. That aside the dumplings are fantastic. We eat them all, albeit more slowly. We wander a bit before heading back. McDonald's burgers and sleep.<br><br>I forget to tell Liz Happy Birthday. Before long she reminds me. At around 11 I head to a nearby street market. I get char siu bao, har gow, pringles, and milk tea and bring them back to Liz for breakfast in bed. We have a lazy morning and finally leave around 3. We grab a quick kebab and head to the Hong Kong History Museum. We learn that the British were the worst, like by starting the opium epidemic to promote trade in the region. There are a few tall towers of bao. We learn Japan also was terrible for quite a while. After the museum we walk around the harbor on the Kowloon side before heading back to the hotel to rest up a bit.<br><br>We catch an early flight for Singapore.	22.297690, 114.171517	Apr 30, 2017	May 4, 2017		Phoenix, Hong Kong, Singapore	1	22.297690, 114.171517	1.281595, 103.847419												https://goo.gl/photos/XQdZXnxBKKi6pFVw5
New Zealand	Surf, Turf, & the Universe	159	x	I catch an early flight from Sydney to Auckland. I won't meet Liz until later. The immigration official at Auckland warns me that my travel lifestyle may look shady. They still let me in though. I head downtown and check into the hotel. Soon I pop out and snack on Dutch chips with mayo and satay from a nearby street vendor. I wander and soon stumble upon the Auckland Arts Fest. There I and listen to a nice Gypsy Jazz band. Back to the hotel where I work for a bit. I decide to walk to Ponsonby. And find a restaurant called Orphan's Kitchen for dinner. It is small and quaint, but I can tell immediately that they will serve some good food. I am not let down. I get house bread with browned butter, pan seared line caught fish and a beer.<br><br>I sleep in a bit and have an early lunch at Federal Delicatessen of a tuna fish sandwich & coffee. I walk up to and around the wharf area, which is undergoing gentrification. I pass an older man s playing haunting, ethereal music on an erhu. A bit further on an older folk duo couple are playing banjo & guitar and singing hymns. I head back to the wharf and meet Liz plus some of her colleagues for a dinner and drinks. From there we head to Housebar for a Penicillin and a Floral Fizz.<br><br>I work and have ramen for lunch. Liz and I head to Blue Breeze for a very good Polynesian themed dinner and Tiki drinks.<br><br>We rent a car and drive south through heavy rain. The rain is so bad we are worried our Hobbiton tour may be canceled. We stop by a store and pick up some rain gear. Just before we arrived to Hobbiton the rain stops completely. The tour goes forward and everything is perfect. We meet at the visitors center and then they drive us on a shuttle into the Shire. We enter through the cutout path Gandalf and Frodo ride into town on. This place is magical and transports me right into Middle Earth. We get to see Bag End, Bagshot row, the Party Tree, Sam's house with Rosie, and many other beautiful hobbit holes before we stop for a pint (it comes in pints!) at the Green Dragon. We buy Bilbo's famous sign for Richard's 60th birthday. From there we head east and stop at a beach on the coast before making south to Whakatane. I meet Juanita, who is amazing and lovely. She then gives us a tour around the bay and then takes us out for a dinner of venison and tempeh.<br><br>Juanita makes us tea and then takes us to the water...she is going to teach us to surf. She has all the gear and takes us out on the water. She is super patient and encouraging. A few times I manage to stand up briefly, which feels pretty cool. We head back, shower and then head for breakfast and coffee in a local cafe. She then shows us a Maori temple, which is beautiful. After that she takes us to some hot springs. She rents Liz and I a private cabana where we enjoy the water for a good while. We part ways and head back to Auckland to catch our flight home.	-37.872115, 175.682940	Mar 8, 2017	Mar 12, 2017	Juanita	Sydney, Katoomba, Blackheath, Auckland, Matamata, Whakatane	3	-33.881582, 151.209877	-36.857273, 174.747661	-37.872115, 175.682940	-37.950612, 176.997080										https://goo.gl/photos/CuN2vLXH9xSfJC226
Sydney	Surf, Turf, & the Universe	157	x	We land and make straight for Basket Brothers for brunch. We order brisket and pork breakfast sandwiches plus some great coffee. Across the street I see a drag queen strutting down the pavement, fanning herself with an entourage of three men behind her. To the hotel and then for Thai massages. We clean up and head for dinner at a posh Chinese restaurant. We have Pig (a cocktail), duck, mushrooms and fried rice. Out for more cocktails at Bulletin Place.<br><br>Liz and I have breakfast in the hotel. She is here for work so I've got the day to myself. Henry Dupuis lives in a nearby town called Katoomba so we plan to hang for the day. I take an hour train ride east, into the mountains and Henry meets me at Katoomb station. He takes me to a cafe and we catch up for a bit. We explore downtown and stop for drinks and wings at a palimpsest pub, which used to be a bank. A local man tells us that the center of the universe is out in the bush. The bartender gives us a shrug implying this happens a lot. We go to meet Henry's partner, Marion, who is working at the local bra shop. From there he and I tour the antique mall. We pick up beers and head to Blackheath, where he lives in a large Victorian house with a few friends. He shows me their big garden and we listen to records in the parlor. I find a big scary spider in the closet. Nobody seems to mind. We grab a kebab and pizza back in Katoomba before I catch the train back to Sydney.<br><br>Liz is working again so I head to Sample for coffee. Liz surprises me and shows up. It is loud and windy though so we head to another place for tea and pasta. She heads back to work and I head to the hotel to relax. In the evening we go to Fire Door for a wood-cooked dinner of bread with smoked butter, prawns, pippies, potatoes, baby gem, and garfish. The staff is especially lovely. They bring out a pork belly dish on the house for us. Everything is beautifuly cooked. The wood cooking approach brings out new textures and flavors in the simple, but quality ingredients.<br><br>We have a quick breakfast and then fly to Auckland.	-33.881582, 151.209877	Mar 4, 2017	Mar 8, 2017		Sydney, Katoomba, Blackheath, Auckland, Matamata, Whakatane	1	-33.881582, 151.209877	-36.857273, 174.747661	-37.872115, 175.682940	-37.950612, 176.997080										https://goo.gl/photos/CuN2vLXH9xSfJC226
Yucca Valley	Power Out	156		Mom picks me up from the airport and takes me for a nice vegan lunch in Palm Springs. From there she drives us up to Yucca Valley and to their house where we meet Jim. We all relax there a bit before heading to Pappy & Harriet's, which is a restaurant in an old Western movie set turned kitchy destination. It reminds me of Pinnacle Peak. We eat steaks, naturally. There is a stage inside and, after dinner, a folk band starts playing tunes. In the middle of a song the power goes out. We'll later learn it went out for half of Yucca Valley. It's quiet and dim. After a few minutes of the power not coming back on the band decides to keep playing. They hop down from the stage and a crowd of about thirty of us gather in close. There is a magical energy about it all. We are rowdy and loving it. Everyone is dancing. For their finale they play I've Just Seen a Face. The crowd loses it. Everyone is shouting along. Falling, yes I am falling. And she keeps calling, me back again. We drive down the mountain in the starlight.<br><br>Mom and Jim drive me to Phoenix. We pass through Joshua Tree on the way. There is a soft mist in the air and a rainbow frames the rugged hills.	34.156357, -116.493103	Jan 18, 2017	Jan 21, 2017	Mom, Jim		1														
Prague	Czeching Out	155	x	We meet Melvin at his. He takes us to IF cafe for snacks. Then we make for the Christmas markets. At the first one we snack on potatoes with mulled wine and then head down to the water for a stroll. Back at Melvin's for drinks in his lovely apartment with his roommate Johann. We have dinner at his place, but I don't remember what we eat. To Hemingway Bar for a first round of cocktails. Anonymous for a second.<br><br>We sleep in. Breakfast at a nearby bakery is coffee, a ham & cheese croissant, an onion bagel with salmon spread, a blue cheese walnut quiche, and a sour cherry galette. We wander the city and visit a busy square. No Rousseau. To a rooftop bar for some drinks. Next to the Louvre bar for more drinks. Back to the house where we have McDonalds & spritzs and play cards.<br><br>I pick up coffee and pastries for all from IF. We head to the castle, buy some candles to place, and eat potatoes, fatty sausage, and a cheese thing. We see the Slav Epic, which was on display, and is definitely epic. We spend a couple of hours taking in twenty massive canvases. Melving takes us to a warehouse cafe that is very charming. We get a risotto with a demi sec and then head back to the airport.	50.084012, 14.414277	Dec 16, 2016	Dec 18, 2016	Melvin, Johann		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/YtySnrg35br56dBB7
Norfolk	I’m on a Boat	154	x	We get a train to Norwich. Lunch is Thai tea, chicken toast, pad see ew, and Panang. We wander the town, see a market, and get handed a Socialist newspaper. To the B&B where we meet Priscilla the cat and take a nap. Next to Strangers Coffee, then Elm Hill with a big Cathedral. The riverwalk is closed, but we meet the kind owner of fish & chip shop. We get fried whitebait, shark bites, and a fried fish burger called the Big Mac(krel). We bring our food next door to the Birdcage bar where we eat it and have a drink. To the Norwich Arts Center for the concert. Paws is okay. Frightened Rabbit is very nice.<br><br>The good: Priscilla spends the whole night with us, is super sweet, and doesn't bother either of our allergies. The bad: she has fleas. We kindly inform her owner of this fact. To Strangers Coffee for good hip hop, nice coffee, a salmon bagel, a pistachio lemon cake, and good cheesy jokes.We ride the train to the broads, wander the very quaint downtown. We walk though some lovely neighborhoods along the water. The water really seems like the thing to do here so we rent a private boat. It is fun, pretty, charming, and lovely. We ride all the way down to Horning and then back. We pull into a lake area to watch the sun set. There are hundreds of birds floating on the water and it is beautiful. To the King's Head for beer, chicken strips and a steak & ale pie. We then train and bus back to London.	52.629968, 1.291590	Dec 3, 2016	Dec 4, 2016		Norwich, Hoveton, Horning	1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/9vd1xzStHp946t2z6
Amsterdam	Colored Sculpture	153	x	Our first stop is to see the Tree Cutter statue - a tiny wooden figure sawing a living branch in a large tree. Next to Bocca for coffee and then Singel 404 for sandwiches. Liz takes us to a photo booth then we look at many beautiful plants in a shop called Wildernis. To the hotel for a nap and then to Salon Serpent for a quick hello to Angelique. We make for the Anne Frank House, which is heart wrenching and very important. To the beer store for beer.

We do a tour of the Bols House and learn a bit about how their spirits are made. One part of the tour has us walk into a small booth, stare into a mirror, and drink a shot of Genever. Then the lights get psychedelic and the floor starts shaking. It's pretty fun. We smell many spices and finish off the tour with a cocktail before getting a bus home.	52.366390, 4.873356	Nov 26, 2016	Nov 27, 2016	Angelique Houtkamp		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/xuZXyiWSUJNMkCeZ7
Frankfurt	Vintage Trains & Sulfuric Salt	152	x	It is already late when we arrive to Briggeta and Uwe's place, but we stay up very late drinking wine and chatting anyway.<br><br>Briggeta makes us breakfast at house. Liz and I head into Frankfurt for the day. Liz buys some 'real' gummy bears and then we head to Kleinmarkthalle — a large food hall. We digest oysters, wine, and sausage. One shop is selling kala namak so we pick some up to take home. Next to the market is a cuckoo clock shop, so naturally we check that out. From there we walk to the main square and then back to the house. B&U makes us a local noodle soup, Frankfurt grüne saus, potatoes, and a prime rib. We drink lots of wine and other fun drinks. They give us a tour of the house, including the sauna and Uwe's model train room, which is fucking awesome.<br><br>Briggeta makes breakfast again and then we head to Mainz, which is where Uwa is from. They take us to a beautiful church with big blue windows. We do a good bit of walking. To another church that smells strongly of incense. We stop in a cafe for coffee and baumkuchen and then visit a printing press museum. Into old town for a good wander. Uwe takes us to Hottum, and old favorite of Uwe's, for wine, more wine, sausage, and schnitzel.	50.112868, 8.683654	Nov 11, 2016	Nov 13, 2016	Brigetta & Uwa	Frankfurt, Klein, Mainz	1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/Js9nJYBBjUMREiMf7
New Orleans	NOLA NY	151	x	Liz and I meet Alexa at her place. We relax for just a few and then head out to lunch. She has made special plans to treat us to lunch at Commander's Palace, where she is working as a bartender. The host seats us at the blue ribbon table. The meal is coursed, so the only thing we need to worry about ordering is cocktails. They bring out garlic bread, beignets, shrimp with pepper jelly, more shrimp, turtle soup, sausage & rice stuffed pigeon, BBQ shrimp, and five different desserts. It is all killer. After the meal Alexa gives us a tour of spice room and wine cellar. Back to her place for a nap. We get dressed up as much as we are able to in preparation for Halloween festivities. Alexa goes as Beetlejuice, I put on some weird drag/joker makeup, and Liz is a cute bird. Our first stop is a Tiki bar. Next to Cane & Table for not-good cocktails. From there we head down to Frenchman St. At BBA we listen to a live band and meet a few Tenenbaums. To Saint by cab where we meet her boy friend. I order something gross.<br><br>We brunch on prime rib benedict, shrimp omelet with crystal sauce, and Bloody Marys at Red Dod Diner. Liz and I head back to Lafayette Cemetery No. 1. We don't see any cats this time, though. After a clean up and a nap we head to Shaya for an Israeli dinner. We share a lamb ragu hummus, pumpkin, brussel sprouts, peppers, halloumi, cabbage, and foie gras. The weather is perfect so we walk for a while to get home.	29.928775, -90.084197	Oct 31, 2016	Nov 2, 2016	Alexa	New York, New Orleans	2	40.680992, -73.920231	29.928775, -90.084197												https://photos.app.goo.gl/vkQrKVesewsk8A5u9
Brooklyn	NOLA NY	150		On the plane I strike up a conversation with a lovely human named Henry Krieger. He wrote the musical Dreamgirls. He gives me his copy of Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania, which he just finished reading. Outside, he even offers to give us a ride into the city, though we politely decline.  We meet Sean at his new (to us) place in Brooklyn. He takes us out for pizza with orange wine and antipasti. Afterward we head to a nearby beer bar for sour stuff and then fall asleep on the train back to the airport.	40.680992, -73.920231	Oct 27, 2016	Oct 27, 2016	Sean	New York, New Orleans	1	40.680992, -73.920231	29.928775, -90.084197												https://photos.app.goo.gl/vkQrKVesewsk8A5u9
Copenhagen	Noma	149	x	After checking into our B&B our first sotp is Meyers Bageri for a cinnamon twist, a cinnamon bun, a poppy cheese fold, and an apple pastry. To Coffee Collective for a cappuccino. We stop in a vintage shopping and I score some sweet, barely worn 80's Adidas. We grab a salad as a sort of cleanse before what we're about to do to our bodies. Someone is in our room. We nap, touch, and then meet Helen & Hera at BBQ place.

We try for smorrebrod, but keep getting turned away. A girl falls in front of us and we're not sure if she's had a seizure. Folks who speak her language help her out. To Ol & Brod for akvavit, smoked venison, egg & chive, veal brisket, chicken salad, tartare, mustard herring, pickled herring, spiced herring. Back to the room for a nap.

Milan	D&B in	146	x	We meet Dad and Barb at the Milan airport. Dad rents a car and drives us to our hotel. We all start with a nice nap and then head up to Bar Luce for coffee, cocktails, bruschetta — roe & strawberry, shrimp & andalouse, salmon & artichoke cream, anchovy & creamy cheese — tiramisu, and pastries. The pinball machine is broken and the bathrooms have a surreal black and white situation going on. Into the city. We arrive at Piazza del Duomo just as the sun has set. The weather is slightly cool and there are a lot of people out. We wander around that area for just a bit before heading back to the hotel. Liz and I are feeling peckish so we head for a late night McDonald's, which is just about a ten-minute walk away. We see a few scantily-clad trans women along the way.<br><br>We have beans for breakfast before Dad drives us to Bergamo, where we quickly stumble upon a street fair. Liz finds baby bunnies in a cage then we buy parmesan and a creamy cheese with pistachios, which we'll munch on for the next couple of hours. There are a lof of old Fiats in this town. We take the funicular to Città Alta. We have lunch at Circolino, an historic prison converted into a beautiful restaurant. Liz and I share a bolognese and a pumpkin ravioli. After lunch we make for the big cathedral in town, which has the most ornate interior I've ever seen—and I've seen my fair share of Italian catherdrals. We all get yummy gelato, D&B buy shoes and we drive back to Milan. For dinner we find a restaurant near the hotel and have a very good seafood pasta and a pizza.<br><br>To a cafe called Tom & Jerry for breakfast. There are about five construction workers standing at the bar sipping espresso. Dad drives us to Como. We explore the charming town a bit and then take a boat ride up the lake. It's a ferry that stops a tiny towns dotted around the lake. We hop off at one that catches our eye. Lake Como is a steep mountain valley lake, which means that this tiny town has a whole lot of stairs. We stop in a cafe for coffee and wine before catcing a boat back to Como. We stop in a restaurant in the main piazza for okay pasta. We're tight on time for the airport, but Dad drives like an Italian to get us there just in time.	45.443803, 9.205316	Oct 15, 2016	Oct 17, 2016	Dennis & Barbara Plunkett	Milan, Bergamo, Citta Alta, Como	1	45.443803, 9.205316	45.705251, 9.661610	45.443803, 9.205316	45.813312, 9.081160										https://photos.app.goo.gl/kT6nkztCp5XLnrWV9
Guernsey	All Around	145	x	Anne and Peter pick us up from the airport and take us to their lovely home. She has some snacks ready for us: gache, croissants and Earl Grey. They take us to a beach where we walk across the causeway, which is only possible during low tide. Peter points out a trench, a Nazi bunker, and cannons all dating from WWII. We work our way clockwise around the island. At the next beach we eat ice cream at a cafe and watch the motocross race happening just down the beach. At the next beach we stop in an old German bunker which has been converted into a restaurant. We continue North and see industrial area. Peter points out St Peter port. They take us to a windy pier that we walk the length of. Back at their home we drink gin, take a nap and Chat with the Millers. For dinner Anne makes us an incredible fish pie and for dessert a Victoria Sandwich.<br><br>More gache, croissants and tea for breakfast and then back to St Peter port where we explore for a bit. To Lorna for a lunch of daiquiri, asparagus, lamb, tart, curd and mallow. We all relax back at house for a bit before they take us back to the airport.	49.454261, -2.529309	Sep 17, 2016	Sep 18, 2016	Anne & Peter Niven		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/JfnQm4KfZ9HXFzR29
Barcelona	Bravas & Pintxos	144	x	We start at Nomad for cold brew and good filter coffee. To the weird b&b where we rest for a bit and then head to a Turkish spot for patatas bravas. We walk by the Gaudi building and then head to a nice place for salted beans & shrimp and pig foot stew with grilled langoustines. It is delicious, though we are a bit squeemish about the the mostly-collagen-and-bone filled foot. THe night is hot.<br><br>Yogurt and cheetos for breakfast. We are dismayed that Nomad is closed, but head to La Puntual for baba ganoush, chicken tacos and iced coffee. We make for the old city and see many churches and shops. I buy a wallet made from old rubber tarp. Nex on our list is Sagrada Familia where we spend a few hours touring the large complex and are just confounded by the beauty of it. We bus into the old city. Liz had one restaurant in mind, but they are full so we opt for next door for patatas bravas, anchovies, croquette and oysters. Our last stop is Leche de Pantera for panther milk before we head to the airport.	41.403656, 2.174380	Sep 2, 2016	Sep 4, 2016		Madrid, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona	4	40.454355, -3.600292	43.315820, -1.989339	43.268666, -2.934018	41.403656, 2.174380										https://goo.gl/photos/cKpsRYdF8hnxhZhk7
Bilbao	Bravas & Pintxos	143	x	I'm not feeling well so we lie in a park for a while. To a store for meat, tinned seafood, bread and cheese. We sit by the river and eat it. We check into our hostel, nap, and then head to the Guggenheim Museum. Frank Gehry was the architect for this museum and it is not pretty. The inside has some good art, though. We see a Warhol color wall, Louise Bourgeois cells, and Picasso. From there we make for the City center where we find a cute spot on the stree for wine with Coke (which is apparently a thing here), artichoke balls, grilled green peppers, and more.<br><br>The morning is lazy and we don't get out of bed until mid day. We snack on bread and cheetos before heading towards old town. A quaint restaurant catches our eye so we pop in and order the best patatas bravas we've had yet. Into old town and across to San Fran. We try for three different coffee shops, all of which are closed. We do manage to find gelato, coffee, gildas, chess and wine, so we're not displease. A woman is grilling sardines in the park so we get one of those. It's juicy and crunchy and salty and delicious. Back to the hostel for a nap. They don't allow drinking here so we pour wine in a water bottle and eat razor clams on the grass out front. We walk to a square where we drink Aperol spritzes, listen to a jazz trio, and play on a massiv jungle gym. Someone snores all night in our room.<br><br>Breakfast is burnt toast. There are no knives and people are drinking the coffee before it is finished being brewed. I get mad and we leave. Instead we get gross ham sandwiches at the airport and catch a bus to Barcelona.	43.268666, -2.934018	Aug 31, 2016	Sep 2, 2016		Madrid, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona	3	40.454355, -3.600292	43.315820, -1.989339	43.268666, -2.934018	41.403656, 2.174380										https://goo.gl/photos/cKpsRYdF8hnxhZhk7
San Sebastian	Bravas & Pintxos	142	x	We fly a prop plane from Madrid. We get a slow bus into the city and head for to the canal. We dine on coffee, wine, and pintxos with anchovies, zucchini, and peppers. To our B&B where we meet our lovely host, Paula. After a nap and a touch we head for more pintxos: pepper stick and caramelized onion & cheese and wine. We walk south to the surfing beach, people watch, play with sand. More wandering through the pretty old city and to La Mejillonera for patatas bravas, calamares bravos, tigre (mussels w/tomato pepper sauce), bread, and beer. More splendid wandering.<br><br>Liz works for a bit and then we go out for coffee, bread, yogurt, guacamole and an egg. To another, more relaxing beach. A young boy picks up a tanning woman's spare thong and walked around the beach showing it to people for at least five minutes. When she gets up and realizes what was going on she is visibly displeased and chides the boys parents for allowing it. We are in hysterics. Lunch is wine, a fried ball of artichoke, ham & zucchini as well as foie gras pinchox with caramelized onion. More pintxos for dinner because they are so good.<br><br>We check out of the B&B, dine on coffee, yogurt, and salmon, and make for Bilbao.	43.315820, -1.989339	Aug 29, 2016	Aug 31, 2016		Madrid, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona	2	40.454355, -3.600292	43.315820, -1.989339	43.268666, -2.934018	41.403656, 2.174380										https://goo.gl/photos/cKpsRYdF8hnxhZhk7
Madrid	Bravas & Pintxos	141	x	Sara picks us up from the beautiful airport and drives us to her apartment with the windows down. The land is brown. Once at her place she makes everyone a lunch of eggplant boats, spinach cannelloni, and salad. After a siesta we head into town. She shows us a large fountain and a pretty post office. It had a large banner strung across the facade stating 'refugees welcome'. To Gymage for foie gras mushroom risotto and spritzes. After that we head to a plaza which is reminicent of Vegas.<br><br>Instant coffee then to El Capricho park bunker for a guided tour. This was built during the Civil War as a place for high-ranking Republicans to retreat from attack by the Nationalists. Afterward we stroll through the park and say hello to ducks and frogs. From there she takes us to a gourmet shop for a foie gras burger. Next we make for the Prado Museum to see Bosch (El Bosco), Rubens, Tintoretto, Goya. We're still in a museum mood so we next make for Reina Sofia and delight in their Picasso pieces. It closes before we are able to finish. To a jambon shop with many hanging pig legs and back home for omelette, salad, lots of ham and sausage, and sweet bread. <br><br>Sara and Stephen take us to the airport for our flight to San Sebastian.	40.454355, -3.600292	Aug 27, 2016	Aug 29, 2016	Sara & Stephen	Madrid, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona	1	40.454355, -3.600292	43.315820, -1.989339	43.268666, -2.934018	41.403656, 2.174380										https://goo.gl/photos/cKpsRYdF8hnxhZhk7
Berlin	Soviet Studies	140	x	The train we catch from the airport is beautiful and very 70's. The design pattern on the seats is tiny Brandenburg gates. This is a neat and dirty city. We head to a neat area and stop at a cafe for a fruit plate and fish plate. Liz accidentally eats some margarine, thinking it is cheese. To be fair, it was right next to the cheese. She knows of a film photobooth in the area so we head there for a shoot. We pass a small photo gallery with small photos of abandoned buildings aroudn Berlin. We buy a photo of an abandoned pool and then head to the Berlin Wall. There is an installation on the wall telling stories of survivors from the Syrian crisis. It is very well done and we both are moved to tears numerous times. We take a quick nap on the ground among cigarette butts before heading to a hostile hostel. Back out, we meet Emma, Phillip, and Alex for a meat-heavy dinner. Emma gets pasta fries. We walk on a bit and stop for beers at the music store/beer shop. Out again to wander through a dark park filled with folk. It fells like the beginning of the Warriors. Alex tells us about the Weimar and the gay SA. The fellowship breaks and Liz & I head to Buck and Breck for an Alaska: gin, Chartreuse, orange bitters and Caribbean Bar Fly: overproof rum, dark rum, Fernet, cherry brandy, Angostura.<br><br>Oily and crispy pancakes at the hostle. The saff is nicer this morning. Liz and I head to Treptower Park for swooping birds, a lie down in the grass, exploration of the Soviet War Memorial, Currywurst, and a sudden rain, a heavy rain, and then a really heavy rain. Once that quiets down we meet back with Alex for a kebab & spicy halloumi sandwich. To the next place for some beer and then a walk. Back home.	52.516367, 13.372017	Aug 5, 2016	Aug 6, 2016	Alex Petrusek, Phil, Emma		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/R2TftmuDmNcSgHvN9

Provence	Lavender	138	x	Stranger Things came out last night so we hardly sleep.<br><br>We get an early flight to Marseille where Anne and Richard pick us up and drive us to the villa. It is a charming two story house set on the rustic a Provencial hillside facing south across a plain of cypress and lavender. Anne & Peter have snacks and drinks ready for us on the terrace.

Liz and I head out with the Nivens for the day. They take us to a town with an ancient Roman site and arena. We spend a few hours wandering the town & church before a pizza lunch. They take us by another lovely town set upon the side of a steep hill before driving us up to Dentelles de Montmirail or the Admirable Lace Mountains. Back at the villa, Liz and I nap by the pool and then paint watercolor postcards.

Paris	Hot Hot Heat	137	x	We get in and head straight to Holybelly for an incredible breakfast. By a liquor store for Suze and then meet Liza at a bakery in the Jewish district where she orders salmon balls and eclairs. To Musee des Arts Forains or the Paris Carnival Museum: Skinny man, horse race game, three carousels, Venetian court, elephant hot air balloon, dark unicorn, and velocipede (bicycle) carousel. The carousel is a blast and feels super dangerous. It is all surreal and lovely and super French. At Liza's apartment I make Suze spritzs and play poorly on the grand piano. Dinner is burgers and steak tartare.<br><br>To a park market for oysters and white wine. We meet Brad and Brian, a couple of her pals, and I buy a buffalo horn comb. We get pistachio gelato. We are stopped in our tracks by a talented and emotive street harpist. To a Jewish deli. Next we do a guided walking tour and appreciate expensive architecture. It is quite warm out and, after a little white, Liz is feeling unwell. We leave the tour to lie down in a park. Liz rests for a wile and Liza and I continue exploring. There are beehives in the park and busts of famous French women. We meet back up with Liz, see a long fountain, and enter an empty church with a beautiful organ. Priests are marching. We visit a Roman arena, drink beer, and lay down in the park. Liz is now suffering from heat exhaustion so we all head home. She goes to bed and Liza and I go to Candelaria for lengua tacos and cocktails. On the train back I get sick. Fortunately I am able to hold it in and at the stop I jump off the train and hurl into a rubbish bin.	48.832739, 2.389099	Jul 16, 2016	Jul 17, 2016	Liza		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/qMqJx9TRy6dHw52u6
The Lake District	Cluedo in	136	x	Gabe and Amy pick us up from the train station and take us to the cute hotel.<br><br>We have a nice English Breakfast and then head out to the forest for a hike. We see monkey trees, a log with thousands of coins jammed into it, and a pretty bridge. Further on, we snack on a 99 in an ancient stone circle. The landscape is sheep and rugged, misty mountains. To a market town for a pub lunch where they must be cooking Gabe's jacket potato from raw. We want to take a boat ride over to the next town, but it is very windy out and they aren't running the ferry. Gabe and Amy buy cheese. Gabe runs quickly up a hill. Back at the hotel we play Boggle and Simpsons Cluedo (with much trickery) while we drink wine and spritzes. We are turned away from the Thai restaurant so we opt for pizza. Back to the room for hot chocolate with Fernet.<br><br>Breakfast and goodbye to Gabe and Amy. Liz and I get too close to a couple swans. We catch a boat to Ambleside. We get some up close time with cows and explore Roman ruins. We look for otters then head to a pub for naughty chips and a BBQ fried chicken sandwich. We hike up to the waterfall and then back down. Busses and trains home.	54.364735, -2.919589	Jul 9, 2016	Jul 10, 2016	Gabe & Amy	Bowness-on-Windermere, Ambleside	1														https://goo.gl/photos/3VdEifNaRMeyK7wo8
The Cotswolds	Drunks and Donkeys	135	x	Men are singing on the train. Anne picked us up at the station. We arrive to her house to find a dead baby bunny on the kitchen floor — a gift from the cat.<br><br>Chocolate croissants and coffee for breakfast. She drives us through a few yellowstone towns. One has a small creek running right through the middle. In another we stop by a pub for jacket potatoes and sandwiches. While visiting an abbey that held vial of fake Jesus blood we get soaked by a sudden burst of rain. The next town is having a fair and the locals are getting wasted. They hold a donkey race that doesn't end well. Donkeys collide and many people go down. The racers are covered in mud after, but fortunately nobody (or donkeys) look seriously injured. For dinner Anne makes a fantastic chicken green curry from scratch. We drink bubbly.<br><br>English breakfast. Antonia arrives. We head to the big abandoned house for an exploration. We nab some raspberry curd from the shop and explored a big church with games for kids. We tour a very old crypt with lead coffins. A mossy fountain and more ruins before catching the train back.	51.795260, -1.882699	Jun 24, 2016	Jun 26, 2016	Anne Bert		1														https://goo.gl/photos/67cPkAmWGbaFbo456
Santorini	Greece Lightning	134	x	We are picked up by nice man and driven to our hotel in Fira. Good falafel in town. There are many thumping clubs. We head into one called Absinthe. I order absinthe (on of the few there who do I'm sure) and Liz has a tropical drink. Pick up pastries for the morning.<br><br>Pastries in the room and coffee in the lobby. Some asshole American abuses the staff. We write a limerick about them:<br><br> Fira's a windy old town<br>With lots of scooters and asshole Americans<br>But if you say you work for American Airlines and talk louder than everyone else<br>Maybe your asshole wife will let you put it in her butt tonight<br><br>To PK bar for a Bloody Mary and a Watermelon Bellini. We move to a new hotel, sleep, then get gyros at Lucky's. After pedis we visit a church on a hill. Gelato, beer and snacks. Hotel pool hangout. Touch. Bed.<br><br>We rent a 150cc ATV. It has some trouble with hills and the trunk is zip-tied on, but it gives us the ability to tour the island in a whole new way. Bad pastries. To Parissa Beach for coffee and a cocktail then chili and a view of nice water. To the next beach. A restaurant with a great view overcharges us for fish. We drive down some dirt roads and find beautiful churches painted white and blue. To Red Beach. We hike down to the very red beach at the bottom of a tall and foreboding cliff. Sugary drinks in the parking lot. Next to Akrotiri lighthouse at the end of the island. We hike around there a bit and then do a meal at a charming restaurant where, when we drove by earlier, the woman owner gave us a big genuine wave and smile. She serves us eggplant with garlic, baked cheese with peppers, moussaka, and homemade strawberry and chocolate ice cream bars for dessert. We buy some caper leaves and sun dried tomatoes from their shop. Next we drive up to the highest point on the island and are treated to stunning views. Below us was a hazy fantasy world. Next we drive to Pyrgos, the only landlocked town on Santorini. It is our favorite place on the island. There are no roads here, just alleys. If M.C. Escher and Gaudi conspired to build a town this would be it. We see MANY cats. This place is basically one giant cat castle. We find TWELVE cats one cute shop where we buy some bowls. In the plaza we have baklava with ice cream. We catch the sunset as we are driving down the mountain. To Lucky's again for gyros.<br><br>We visit a magical grocery store near the hotel. It is dimly lit inside and smells a bit stale. The meat & cheese cases are shrouded in a forest of herbs. Hardly any space is untouched and nothing is in its plastic packaging. To Fira for coffee and gelato. The woman behind the counter praises us for our manners. Lucky's gyros again. I want to ride a donkey down to the port. Liz is not so fond of the idea, but acquiesces. It is harrowing, exciting, and smelly. The port is very touristy so we soon take the cable car up. Nap. To Santo Winery where we hang for a few hours and do a tasting of 18 wines and eat more cheese than we knew possible. There is not much of a sunset due to the heavy haze, but we thoroughly enjoy ourselves. A bunch of Americans flag down a bus and get us back to Fira.<br><br>ATV excursion day 2, the north half. Pastries, coffee, and a 300cc ATV. It is a much better machine. To a nice, but hot beach where we don't stay long. Next beach. We eat at a quaint, but slow restaurant. Liz is a bit grumpy about this plus the fact that the food isn't very good. We follow a tour group down to what we discover is a nude beach with gorgeous views...of the cliffs. The group leaves and there are only a few folks around so I partake in the dipping. The weather and water are great. Next we drive to Ammoudi bay. There are octopodes drying on a line. We eat tzatziki fries, grilled mussels in mustard sauce, and grilled squid. Back to Fira for beer & Lucky's.<br><br>We ride a dizzying bus to Oia and arrive to our freshly built, surreal-minimalist hotel. We take a dip in the cool pool. Back to Ammoudi Bay for a not-as-good-as-before meal. We climb the cliff and catch a crisp sunset from the steps. People clap for it and it is quite charming. Baklava and ice cream. Liz buys a ring. Back at the hotel we snack on wine, olives, and Cheetos while sitting on our balcony.<br><br>Liz wakes early to look for a kitten, but no luck. Back to bed. We explore Oia a bit and eat crispy pita, tzatziki, stewed beef & tomatoes, and roast lamb with onions & garlic for lunch. Back to Fira and then the airport.	36.364512, 25.382425	May 29, 2016	Jun 4, 2016		Athens, Santorini	2	37.977399, 23.729855	36.364512, 25.382425												https://goo.gl/photos/63hdLZKgXPUy9r7z8
Athens	Greece Lightning	133	x	People clap when we land in Athens. Around the city there are many potted plants and feral cats, which gives it a welcoming vibe. We check into the hostel and nap a bit. Into a local park where we sit under a dead wisteria ramada and snack on fresh roasted corn & nuts. A few minutes on, we walk by the first Olympic stadium. The sun goes down and the city is beautiful. We find a lovely church in the middle of a shopping district. Near it is Baba Au Rum, where we relax with a rum negroni, a chocolate cherry biscuit drink, a Devil's Milk, and a Smoking Mexican. Late night pizza and falafel from a corner shop.<br><br>Liz wakes up with a very swollen eye and forehead, but it goes down gradually throughout the day.We grab freddo espresso and crepes from the 24hr shop before walking to the Acropolis where we get real hot and sweaty. Then to the airport to catch our flight to Santorini.	37.977399, 23.729855	May 28, 2016	May 29, 2016		Athens, Santorini	1	37.977399, 23.729855	36.364512, 25.382425												https://goo.gl/photos/63hdLZKgXPUy9r7z8
Las Vegas	Lights & Libations	132	x	Went to Sephora to claim Liz's free b-day gift. To Louis Vuitton to experience Akhob by James Turrell. Tool the lift to the top floor. The doors opened to a dark room and two beautiful women in all white waiting for us. It felt like the Milk Bar in Clockwork Orange. They offered us a San Pellegrino. We took our shoes off and proceeded to spend twenty minutes in space. The all white walls were washed with such even color that our eyes could not grasp the dimensions of what we were looking at. It was disorienting and incredible. To the Bellagio for a salmon crepe and a beet salad. To the Flamingo for some light gambling. The colors in that hotel are lovely. To some outlet shops. Then to Fremont. Saw a Navajo marionette. Drink & Drag was shut down. To Hash House for the big dish we love. More gambling, more losing. Video poker was fun. Drinks at Frankie's Tiki Room.	36.107818, -115.173693	May 19, 2016	May 20, 2016		New York, Las Vegas	2	40.726178, -73.981885	36.107818, -115.173693												
New York	Lights & Libations	131		We get first class to NY. I dine on duck breast and watch The Day the Earth Stood Still. After landing we head straight to Mother of Pearl, a super cute Tiki bar. Drinks are Tide is High and Mexican Summer: watermelon sugar rim. Our next stop is Please Don't Tell. The facade is a hot dog shop and there is a line so we order a dog with cream cheese and everything sprinkles. Once in the bar we get Pisco, vermouth, kumquat, cardamom; Celery, gin, vermouth, Cointreau; Chamomile, lemon, honey. Keeping it going, we head to Attaboy. The wait is too long though so we take the train to the JFK to get some sleep before our next flight.<br><br>Quick stop in Phoenix for Cartel, In-N-Out, Target, Phoebe's grad, and CPK.<br><br>Then to Vegas.	40.726178, -73.981885	May 17, 2016	May 19, 2016		New York, Las Vegas	1	40.726178, -73.981885	36.107818, -115.173693												
Tønsberg	Warm Times	130	x	Silje meets us at the station. She takes us back to her flat and serves us salmon, potato, and pickles. From there we go with her to test drive a car. We have an early night.<br><br>Breakfast is a now familiar eggs, toast, liver, and pickles. We tag along with her to the cat sanctuary and help her clean...and play with lots of cats. Home and a light lunch. She then takes us to the End of the World, which is a beautiful rocky beach. We are strolling through a quaint neighborhood when she casually points out Edvard Munch's house. We get burgers for dinner and head back to her place, where I introduce her to AJJ.<br><br>After breakfast we explore the town. Liz buys two Lucie Kaas bowls. Lunch at the house and then Silje takes us to a forest, which was build by an oil company. There are many small hills, which she informs us are viking burial mounds. We take some pretty pictures before heading back. Liz and I make a roast chicken dinner.<br><br>Breakfast,  downtown exploration, and to the docks. We get soft serve and watch flappers tap dance on the boardwalk. At a seaside cafe we order a fish cake sandwich and fish soup. We part ways, take the train to Oslo, buy groceries, and head back to Espen & Omar's place. They are hosting two other surfers, Alex and Dan. We stay up late talking about politics. Espen shows us creepy videos of men dressed up as clowns scaring people in parks at night.<br><br>Eggs, bread and other interesting things. We walk to a nude beach and also to a regular beach. We say goodbye to the boys and head to the folk museum. There are many gorgeous black and brown buildings. There is also a very cool-looking black church, a few old storehouses, and a petting zoo. There  are some very cute bunnies and I think Liz may be crying.	59.266446, 10.404865	May 3, 2016	May 8, 2016	Silje	Oslo, Svalbard, Tønsberg	3	59.927725, 10.698891	78.225151, 15.649737	59.266446, 10.404865											https://goo.gl/photos/1kzuqSrJtjXw5Ftj7
Svalbard	Warm Times	129	x	We land and ride a bus to our hotel. There is snow on everything. We check in and sleep a while. After a couple of hours we get up and walk into town. We head in a grocery store and pick up bread, tinned mackerel and liver. A little further on and we are at the water. Back to our room, we snack and return to our slumbers.<br><br>Breakfast is coffee, cereal, brown cheese, caviar from a tube, and pickles. We have a glacial boat tour booked today so we head down to the water and get on board. We meet the sweet doggo and set sail. The mountains are white and majestic as we head through the fjords. Our guide tells us about "suicide birds" who, after losing their, mate will plunge down into the icy water, never to come back up for air. Later we try to confirm this on the internet and are able to find no corroboration. As we delve further into the fjords our boat starts breaking through (relatively) thin sheets of ice. The chef on board serves us a lunch of salmon, whale, rice, salad, and bread. We cruise by a massive glacier. It is the first glacier I had ever seen and it is awe inspiring. We hoped to make it on land to Pyramiden (an abandoned Russian mining town), but the tell us there is still too much ice blocking the way. It is very cold in the boat and not comfortable. We pass by a tiny cabin where, almost 100 years ago, a dozen men died because they were stuck there for a winter and got lead poisoning from cooking their food in the can instead of transferring them to pots. Back to land and to the hotel. We eat cheese puffs and cuddle in bed.<br><br>Breakfast is the same. I give Liz a palimpsest Bel-Air birthday card before we head to the Museum of Svalbard, where we spend the next couple of hours learnign about this geography and history of this incredibly remote place. Back to the airport and en route to Tønsberg.	78.225151, 15.649737	May 1, 2016	May 3, 2016		Oslo, Svalbard, Tønsberg	2	59.927725, 10.698891	78.225151, 15.649737	59.266446, 10.404865											https://goo.gl/photos/1kzuqSrJtjXw5Ftj7
Oslo	Warm Times	128	x	Driving into the city we spot some pretty funky looking modern buildings. We meet Espen, our Couchsurfing host, by the Burger King. He takes us to Espresso House for creamy coffee and nice sandwiches. Then head walks us through the city and to his home where we meet Omar, his partner, and Kayak, their dog. Omar and I discuss Javascript and Arduino. We head to the grocery store to take in all the weird food (there are many types of fish in toothpaste tubes) and pick up ingredients for dinner. Liz and I make asparagus pesto spaghetti and cold chocolate bulges for our hosts.<br><br>For breakfast Omar makes arepas with black beans, butter, and cheese as well as coffee, bacon, and meatballs. The arepas are warm, chewy, and slightly crispy bits of masa, which is a common dish in his home country of Venezuela. We all stroll together outside and admire at the lovely homes. We see a dog bar, an orange barn, and some very black houses. To Vigelandsparken, a big park in the middle of the city, and take in many interesting concrete statues such as a baby, women with aliens, angry men, a girl with a unicorn, and Monolitten, 17 meters of bodies shaped into a monolith. Surrounding the spire are 36 statues which included a mother being ridden by her children, a woman with oily breasts (from people putting their hands on them), and a child on pile of children. All of the statues are nude. Next we walk to Uptown and get more coffee from Espresso House and  take in some truly stunning architecture. The city hall is a massive brick cube and reminds me of the local brown cheese. We run to catch the ferry and then tour the Fjord. We see the shipyard, summer cottages, the big ski jump, Rodruss, and a fortress. Back on dry land we stroll by the opera house and see students dancing out front. To parliament. Very near to is the Stonecutters Freemason building. Next we see a dirty clown. Liz guides us to Fuglen for truly excellent coffee. Back to their place for spicy Thai and homemade pizza. Hugs and goodbyes.<br><br>Breakfast smoothies. Omar takes us to his office building and shows us a view of Oslo from its 2nd tallest building. Coffee and croissants. Train. Plane. Tromsø. Svalbard.	59.927725, 10.698891	Apr 30, 2016	May 1, 2016	Espen & Omar	Oslo, Svalbard, Tønsberg	1	59.927725, 10.698891	78.225151, 15.649737	59.266446, 10.404865											https://goo.gl/photos/1kzuqSrJtjXw5Ftj7
Coventry	Weekend in	127	x	The wide roads here remind us of America. To the Ska Museum. We dine on a full English breakfast, Jamaican sausage, and a cappuccino in the museum cafe. Some teenage boys come in and get breakfast with tea. Into the museum. There is a special event on the 2nd floor, which we happen to catch in perfect time. The Shapes, a punk band from Coventry in the 70's, is here and talking with a small crowd. They answer question, tell entertaining stories and play a few songs. Their big hit is called Batman in the Launderette. Afterward we take photos with them. We walked with a few of the band members to their car so we can buy a vinyl, which they sign for us. Back to the museum to take it in. There is a lots of great two-tone memorabila. We meet a docent, who is the mother of the lead singer from the Primitives. We get some vinyl from the gift shop before heading out. We wander the university and cathedral area, then snack on grapes and and encounter some inconsiderate footballers outside of the Museum of Transportation. We learn that Coventry was the UK's Motor City. There are some very cool vintage bicycles on display. Halfway through the museum they close for the day. We eat some very Chinese food then pick up beer and artichoke hearts from the store for our couchsurfing hosts, Marie & Joe. They make us tea and Liz works on a puzzle. We discuss slugs, laundry, gender, and history before having a cold & uncomfortable sleep on the floor.<br><br>We chat a bit more and then out. To Hampstead cafe and then the big cathedral, which had been badly bombed in World War #2. The town has done much restoration work over the years and it is very beautiful now. There are many diverse features and intricate designs set in a humble and minimalist space. Across the street, in the Herbert Art Gallery, is a Grayson Perry exhibit so we head there next. There are something like eight large tapestries primarily inspired by the Rake's Progress. They are quite cool and we spend a good hour taking them all in. There is also a TV program playing in a side room where Grayson explore people's homes. We head back to the Transport Museum to do the 2nd half. After that it's beetroot chutney, beef rib ramen, and soft shell crab tempura before catching the train back to London.	52.410455, -1.483671	Apr 23, 2016	Apr 24, 2016			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/cA8NwE2s56gUwGHa7
Brussels	Treats in	126	x	Night bus, ferry, bus. Quiet station. Many soldiers. Early market. Friends. Sleep. Wake. Crepes. Laeken Greenhouses. Pretty pictures. Pretty flowers. Silly humans. Pretty humans. One room is straight out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Tea and cakes in the cafe. To Peck 47 for great sandwiches. The we partake in a photobooth in a bar. It is malfunctioning and keeps taking pictures of us. Wonderful! I buy two grapefruit and pretend they are my boobs. Melvin had prepared marzipan treats for us. It is cold at first, but the heater soon warms us up. I stand outside, above the cold city. The city is quiet. A few birds are having a conversation across the rooftops. The sun sets over the city. Back inside, Liz is wearing a blanket which makes her even more cat-like. We all draw. Melvin makes us sweet blue milk and crepes. We listen to music until the laptop dies. Lights off. Star lamp on. We make hand monsters in the shadows. Slumber party for a while until we finally go to our room.<br><br>Breakfast. Boca Moca. Back to the same street market. Pin Pon for fish & chips and a lot of steak tartare. Plants. Vintage goods. Coffee. Rain. Alexia makes us spaghetti carbonara with egg yolk on top. We take a family photo and get a rooftop farewell from my bird friend.	50.890828, 4.359141	Apr 16, 2016	Apr 17, 2016			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/mJB9Nh5g5nD1E5Gt5
Liverpool	Portobello on Toast	125	x	First we confirm the secret phone booth entrance for the truly hidden speakeasy we will later visit. We walk to Bold St Coffee for creamy portobello and garlic on toast and coffee. Back to the phonebooth (Ex-Directory). We enter, call the correct number, and a secret door opens, which reveals a sprial staircase. We descend into a quiet and quaint bar for a sherbert & tonic, a chili beet bloody mary, an Aristocracy Flip, and a Darjeeling Limited. Next we head to a record fair and where I find some Undertones. We sit on some church steps and feel very cold. Women walk by in short dresses with very high heels. More walking to Mowgli where we dine on treacle chips, house lamb curry, chickpeas in black tea sauce, mother butter chicken, and fry bread. No absinthe. We catch a bus to our B&B. Our host is very quiet and has a silly kitty.<br><br>She (our host) is more sociable in the morning. To the Walkes Museum for nice contemporary art. Bold St again for coffee and mushrooms. Next to the docks for the Tate Liverpool Museum. There is a Greek statue among a large pile of clothes. Bold St again! Maray for dinner for broccoli w/cheese, falafel, burrata w/honey and grilled peach, plus fried chicken thighs.	53.408731, -2.987444	Apr 9, 2016	Apr 10, 2016			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/tQgkpEdMBx3sWc1x6
Manchester	Pigeons	124	x	It is raining. We catch a free bus to the Science and Industry Museum. Liz pulls hummus from her backpack and we snack on that. Art, recycling, large train engines, bisected engine, pump room pumps, cotton combing and spinning. Next door we down a big plate of chips, drink some beers, and listen to And She Was. Liz knows of a shop with a vintage photobooth so we walk there and get our picture taken. From there we wanter the North Quarter. To a cocktail bar called Keko Moku for toasted coconut Mai Tai and Porn Oil. Next to Almost Famous for grilled cheese and a great burger. We're walking by a train station I recognize the intersection we're at from a famous photo of a drunk man lying down on the street who resembles the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Naturally I lay down and recreate the photo. We meet David, our Couchsurfing host, at the petrol station. His house is surreal and dream like. There are keys all over the floor, there is color all over the ceiling, and there are panoramas photos taped up on all over the walls. We drink beer on the floor and then he takes us to a pub with a chair nailed up on the wall. He tells us that Roger Daltrey once sat in it. A young guy is performing on acoustic guitar and does a pretty bad job of a Matchbox 20 song. To another pub. This one has a nu goth punk band playing. The lead singer is in his late fourties and has on some thick eyeliner. A man probably in his sixties, who appears to be a hair-metal guru is thoroughly enjoying it. What a charming culture smash. We sleep on the top bunk.<br><br>Up and into the city. To Idle Hands for pungent cold brew and mascarpone tasting v60 drip. Onward to Rudy's Pizza for Campari soda, smoked mozzarella, broccoli, & kalamata pizza, and a tomato mushroom pizza. Everything is delicious. A man is playing ethereal kora in a central square near the train station. Others are drumming and others dancing. The weather was perfect. Someone else is feeding a flock of pigeons. To the Manchester Museum. There are boxed herbs and a pineapple vase. We control a robot in another room and are able to send communications with people in that room. In another hall, two sentient wheelchairs seem to be having relationship difficulties and print messages to visitors on receipt paper. We walk through the gay district. A woman walks up to us and asks us for money. She has fresh blood on her forehead. We give her some. Two stylish women—one serving young Marlon Brando, the other Mary Murphy—have a touching embrace before departing separate ways at the train station.	53.484263, -2.229463	Apr 2, 2016	Apr 3, 2016			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/284TAp6w99bRKiKw7
Dubrovnik	Dalmatia	123	x	We meet our host, Slobodan, and soon walk to the old city where we eat sushi and see MANY cats.<br><br>Toay is Easter so no bakeries are open. Instead we go toa bar called Pinkey's for our morning coffee. It's a dive bar, but pretty charming. Liz has some trouble taking off her pants because she forgot to take her shoes off first. To the old town and a pretty square where we eat squid ink risotto and then Nutella and caramel gelato. We then feed some cats cheese. We hop on a bus to the south side of the city. We walk to the water, sit on a rock, and watch the waves crash against the ancient stone walls. More wandering around the centuries old town. We drink some coffee in a posh hotel and then head back to Pinkey's for beer. Back to the old city, we find a quaint spot and order two types of gnocchi. The first is a Croatian 'Dirty Gnocchi' with beef sauce and cinnamon. The second has with pesto, olives, shrimp, and tuna. Both are unbelievably incredible and the best gnocchi we've ever tasted. Each 'noodle' was the size of a shotgun shell and as soft as a down pillow.	42.641389, 18.108314	Mar 26, 2016	Mar 28, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	8	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Mostar	Dalmatia	122	x	The coffee shops are all Turkish. There are many men trying to get me to park in their parking lot. We see take in the sensory experience of being somewhere so different...crumbling buildings, Mosques, Christian churches, tiny dark shops filled with trinkets, a fairytale bridge. A man standing in the middle looks ready to jump, but appeaers to be waiting for someone to give him money. No kissing in the Mosque. We lunch on a lovely tuna pate. We head down the highway. Shortly after leaving Mostar it gets incredibly dark. The GPS tells us we need to get to a parallel highway about 5 miles to the west of us, but when we follow the turn off we are immediately on a very scary, bumpy dirt road. We back up and try the next turn off. It was a similarly scary, bumpy dirt road. We don't have much choice at this point so we drive it. We don't really talk for the 10 or so minutes it takes to cross the valley. We are certainly not imagining getting killed by a gang of desert bandits. Nope. Definitely not thinking that at all.

Split	Dalmatia	121	x	As we are trying to get down the tiny streets to our B&B I get stuck—with about six other cars—in parking jam in a cul-de-sac. We were pretty much in the middle of the madness. I am okay at driving manual, but the skill needed to get out of this is beyond my ability. Fortunately a kind man, who turns out to be a local college professor and who is a whiz in a stick, hops in our car and squeezes it in a tight spot that allows the others to un-jam. Up the stairs to our adorable B&B where we met Tatiana. She give us homemade Orahovac (walnut liqueur) and snacks. It is all delicious. We walk down the water to Fife where we eat fried squid and whole grilled sea bass. From ther we proceed to explore the old city. More Steinbeck at night. It doesn't feel like we're in the 21st century<br><br>Pastries on the slabwalk. We see bunnies, chicks, ducklings, and a box of snails for sale at the local market. We have to pass through six different checkpoints to get into Bosnia.	43.506750, 16.438095	Mar 25, 2016	Mar 26, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	6	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Sibenik	Dalmatia	120	x	The B&B is quaint, as are the streets. We head to a smoky bar and listen to the Spin Doctors. We eat some great pizza and see a cat and dog fight. The cat wins.<br><br>After a nice touch I accidentally made a cup of foam with no coffee in it. To Park Krka where we walked around many waterfalls. We name a mountain "BJ Mountain" before heading to Split.	43.734526, 15.890963	Mar 24, 2016	Mar 25, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	5	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Zagreb	Dalmatia	119	x	To Ozujsko pub for cheap beer, burgers, and excellent beer sausages resting atop a foothill of fries. We walk up the mountainside to the Museum of Broken Relationships, a museum which features personal objects from lost partners and lovers. Each item is accompanied by as story. We read about an axe, a melted medal, an empty bottle of conditioner. Next we head to our hosts home. We share beer & Milka with our hosts Robert, Maja, and Ferdo (their pet chinchilla). We wipe the poop pellets off of the couch and then slept on it.<br><br>Cheesy pastries for breakfast and out to a bustling city morning. Our first stop is the Museum of Illusion. This is pretty cool and not just for selfies. Liz finds and completes a Tower of Hanoi; a puzzle which requires moving a stack concentric disks from one post to another, one at time. To the airport where we pick up a rental car. We dirve straight to Plitvice Park, a gorgeous natural forest with a boardwalk passing over the many small streams. There are many pretty waterfalls and we see a cute duck couple. We take a boat across the lake and then drive onto Sibenik.	45.815019, 15.973434	Mar 23, 2016	Mar 24, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	4	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Ljubljana	Dalmatia	118	x	This town has a lot of graffiti. It reminds me of Glasgow. The sky is gray. The buildings, where not tagged, are gray. I wonder if this is what Berlin was like in the 90's. We head to the hostel, but only stop in for a few before we go explore the city center. It is beautiful. The buildings here have color and are richly ornamented. We sit down at a cafe on the river and drink spritzes. At night I read Steinbeck. We sleep in a basement.<br><br>The bus to Zagreb is late. Apparently I take a guy's seat. I don't get up.	46.050631, 14.506049	Mar 22, 2016	Mar 23, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	3	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Venice	Dalmatia	117	x	It is a bustling morning. The buildings are weathered, the brick crumbling, tha paint worn, and tourists fresh. An musician on the street has a one-man-band setup including accordion, a kick drum, a hi-hat, and a Tin Man funnel hat. It is Psalm Sunday. As we are walking down a narrow, cobblestone street, a group group of Catholics participating in some sort of parade mass come marching down the street in our direction. The priests are singing a beautiful hymn, presumably in Latin. Catholicism in Europe seems a lot more interesting and aesthetically pleasing than in America. We pay an exorbitant price for a coffee in a cute square. To our hotel. Tatiana is lovely. The towels on the bed are shaped like swans kissing. Liz buys a Venetian leaf mask for her dad. To the famous square where we see the gondola men waiting for or starting up rides. We walk to Harry's Bar where we have coffee and a bellini. Next we stroll down the grand canal. Dinner is meat and cheese in the hotel room. Dessert is each other.<br><br>Tatiana delivers breakfast in the room. We make a spritz before taking a boat to Cimitero, the cemetery island. There are flowers all over. It does not feel particularly haunted. Another boat to Murano. Seemingly every other shop here sells some type of glass product. It is all very beautiful. I take some aderall. We buy plates for Anne and Dad & Barb. Bread, snacks and coffee in the square. We spend a few hours exploring the island, taking really good photos, and having lovely conversation. We pass by a house where the occupant hung their laundry in a rainbow spectrum. As we are taking photos of it, she pops her head out and smiles at us. We do our best to communicate our appreciation for her subtle art. Another boat to Burano where the buildings are all painted in vivid colors. We eat cheap pizza, play with cats, and watch the sun set below the houses. To Torcello where a man plays a lovely rendition of La Vie en Rose on accordion. Back to Venice. I nearly accidentally steal someone's bread at the grocery store. We stroll the town at night and ride the canal boat.<br><br>Breakfast delivery again before taking the train to Triste. We ride a tram up the mountain and hop on a heavily-graffitied train towards Ljubljana.	45.439150, 12.342401	Mar 20, 2016	Mar 22, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	2	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Verona	Dalmatia	116	x	Being here feels like being in a painting. We arrive at the Colosseum square during golden hour. There are fresh flowers all around. We get cubed cheese served in a cone and walk along Colosseum. In an adjacent square we sit in a cafe and enjoy spritzes, a fine cappuccino, and delicious pizza. Next we take in some ceramic art and proceed to nap in the grass. To our B&B, which is absolutely precious. Our room is the Romantic Suite and is decorated in all things pink. It is gaudy, over the top, and absolutely charming. There are delicious little treats hidden all around the room. This is Alice in Wonderland, withouth all of the killing. After a while we head out to explore the castle and take in the sights. We lay by the river for a while. When the sun goes down we find a quaint spot for where we drank spritzes and eat donkey ragu, sardine & fennel macaroni, and gelato. We wander the area around the Roman theatre in the dark.<br><br>A quick cold shower, coffee, and a train to Venice.	45.438593, 10.992716	Mar 19, 2016	Mar 20, 2016		Verona, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sibenik, Park Krka, Split Mostar, Dubrovnik	1	45.438593, 10.992716	45.439150, 12.342401	46.050631, 14.506049	45.815019, 15.973434	43.734526, 15.890963	43.506750, 16.438095	43.337280, 17.815115	42.641389, 18.108314						https://photos.app.goo.gl/3qVtBC5BBGPjkwX89
Paris	Dirty Dick	115	x	Early ride on the Eurostar. To Holybelly for a breakfast of great coffee, hash brown tangles, honey goat cheese, and chives on eggs. Nap in the hotel and then walk to Muji. Lunch is a chicken curry sandwich and hot dog. We wander through a shady street market to a very 80's antique mall. We see many great shops including one that sells old printing press letters. To Mary Celeste for a delicious spritz and an Autumn Blossom. Next to Candelaria for a variation on a martini and something smoky and sweet for Liz. Onward to Little Red Door for a tiki drink and a Spots and Dots. Next to Mabel's for more great drinks. Before bed, Liz looks at her phone and discovers we walked 12 miles today.<br><br>To Fondacion for coffee and cake and then to a massive street antique market. There is a lot of mid-century stuff. We eat Andouillette and fries. To Institute de Bourse for nice coffee in very hot ceramic cups. The big canal is empty. We snack on a ham, egg, and cheese crepe and a Nutella crepe. To printing press letter shop #2 for another look around. We're right by Moulin Rouge, so we have a look the the big windmill before heading to Dirty Dick. It's an very cool tiki bar. They are playing Messer Chups, a Russian Surf Rock band. We drink two Monkey Seeds, a Ward 69, and a Dark Shaman. We meet Alvin for a brief hello. Dinner is Chinese. To Le Syndicat for bare walls, hip hop, and great drinks, one of which included beet juice.<br><br>Eurostar back to London.	48.871038, 2.359637	Jan 30, 2016	Feb 1, 2016	Alvin		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/hx8F31xqgPQLgBC57
Reykjavik	New Year	114	x	We wait outside the train station in the very cold air & snow for a bus into town. There are ducks and swans in the water. Once in town we in and immediately out of a curry place because it was $25-30 for a curry. Instead we opt for pretty good pizza and a bland kebab across the street. After a long walk in the snow we reach a bonfire on the river, which we learned is a celebration point for the new year festivities. It is deserted, but warm. From there walk a short distance to our hostel where we meet our roommates for the night. They are a man and woman, both geologists. We hit it off right away. Just before midnight we run back out to the bonfire and are just in time for the fireworks. They are not launched from a central spot, but rather from all around the city. The effect is that we are, for a short time, encircled by a forest of sparkling light. It is magical. Right there in the snow Liz pops open a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and we have a toast to the new year. Back inside we learn about cattle hydration and tectonic plates. I snore all night, apparently. Sorry.<br><br>A late breakfasat of hot dogs from Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur, a very popular hot dog stand serving tradition (to Iceland) dogs with are topped with ketchup, brown gravy, and crispy onions. Then to the big church. We miss mass, but are still able to hear a man play the rich, atmospheric organ. The sun is going down and we walk along the water with hopes of catching the Aurora Borealis. Dinner is tasty Thai noodles followed by drink in the London Underground themed Kaffibarinn. At the hostel we watch Smarter Brother.<br><br>We get killer bagels from Kaffitar and then head to the Phallological Museum where we disover just how unsexy penises can be. A dog jumps on me. A quick snack of more hot dogs from Bæjarins (they were so good) and then fish stew, a fish kebab, and a potato kebab at Sea Baron. We catch a bus for our Northern Lights tour. They drive us about 30 minutes outside of the city to a place which is meant to be a great viewing spot. We dont't see any with our eyeballs, but I take many long-exposure shots that catch some very pretty shades of green. Two more hot dogs (5.5 total for me) and then to sleep in a very cold room.	64.149870, -21.942839	Dec 31, 2015	Jan 3, 2016			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/acVabZnvoyjsn2cv8
Basel	Much ADo	113		This town doesn't fancy us so we pretty quickly head onto Saint-Louis. This is much nicer. Good pizza. Our Airbnb smells like smoke, but Alicia is a kind woman, has some fun music to share, and I don't poop the bed, so it was a good night.<br><br>We get up, return the car (which I only stall once), and go the fuck home.	47.559040, 7.588362	Dec 13, 2015	Dec 14, 2015		Freiburg, Basel	2	47.997181, 7.841577	47.559040, 7.588362												https://photos.app.goo.gl/YczJkYS9Yc3wW5Wo6
Freiburg (NSFW)	Much ADo	112	x	I throw up on the bus to Stansted. I quickly realize I have either food poisoning—possibly from a batch of homemade sauerkraut Liz just made—or a case of Norovirus. We make it to Basel. I feel like hell. We get a manual car, which I now know how to drive (*see Tahiti trip) and drive to Freiburg. Luch is potato soup w/weiner and pumpkin lasagna in a quaint restaurant. People stare at us, I'm not sure why. Mid-eating I am struck with an allergy attack and proceed to sneeze intensly and consistently (a few times a minute) throughout the rest of the meal. We meet the lovely Marta and her son Niko from Poland at their Airbnb. I had mention that I'm not feeling well and Marta makes us a batch of yummy and restorative lemon ginger water. I awake from a nap with a wet butt. I throw those undies away. 2 undies left. Out to the Christmas Market where we eat potato cakes and a nutella crepe. Back and to bed. I awake in the middle of the night. It happened again. 1 undies left. I pad the final pair heavily with TP and go back to bed. Not long after I am up again. I change the padding and throw up my lunch & dinner. Liz is now also feeling ill; though fortunatley without the incontinence.<br><br>Morning. 0 underwear left. Cold balls. We attempt to shop for new briefs, but it's a Sunday in Eurpoe and all the shops are closed. Lunch is soup and a nice brat. We drive up to the edge of the Black Forest and explore a cute town on a hill. We take photos, find cats, and then drive to Basel.	47.997181, 7.841577	Dec 12, 2015	Dec 13, 2015		Freiburg, Basel	1	47.997181, 7.841577	47.559040, 7.588362												https://photos.app.goo.gl/YczJkYS9Yc3wW5Wo6

Strasbourg	Oktoberfest	110	x	To a burger place. We come upon a very nice church. We stay in a charming and cheap room.<br><br>Another lovely church. Pari-Brest, abricot, and cheesy bread for breakfast. The river is Monet-like, as is pretty much this entire town. We let ourselves get lost wandering the quaint streets. After a while we find a nice cafe in a square where we drink coffee and eat foie gras. We take a boat to a busier area where we encounter tour groups on boats, bicycles, foot, and Seaguey. I take some nice photos of Liz on a bridge. We catch some nice scenery then stop by a sandwich shop for one baguette with ham & pickled veggies and another with salmon and cheese. Both are excellent. We eat them in front of the futuristic Victorian train station before going inside to, reluctantly, catch a train home.	48.579944, 7.750740	Sep 21, 2015	Sep 22, 2015		Salzburg, Munich, Strasbourg	3	47.801280, 13.044909	48.138509, 11.575579	48.579944, 7.750740											https://photos.app.goo.gl/KSPG9F3L2doTkxf16
Munich	Oktoberfest	109	x	Many humans. Many drunk. Some folks wear posh suede lederhosen, man more wear cheap costumey lederhosen. Into the madness. It is essentially a massive carnival with extra beer tents. We get a big beer and sit on a bench to begin drinking. Next to us is a nice German man who happens to be an exotic animal dentist. Prost. Remember to make eye contact. Currywurst. Wow Germans speak great English. Another beer. We smoke a Lucky Strike. Wow, that's a lot of beer. Wow, that's strong beer. We spend most of the evening at the Augustiner tent. Another sausage. I am so drunk that my jaw locks up. I can hardly open it enough to eat the brat. I have to pee so bad I cav hardly walk. Wow, we are really drunk. I think we eat fries later.<br><br>Terrible falafel. Terrible hangover. Back to the party. The beer hall smells disgusting. People are chanting loudly and smacking their tankards on the tables in unison. Everything feels gross. A nice horn band is playing. We eat rooasted river fish on a stick. It is salted, crunchy, bony, and delicious. Aebleskiver on an edible foam plate. We go on a cute 'scary' ride. It has giant chattering teeth and is reminiscent of the ride in Amilee. We watch people tumble down a conveyor belt leading up to a toboggan for at least half an hour. More meat sticks and then a rideshare to Strasbourg.	48.138509, 11.575579	Sep 20, 2015	Sep 21, 2015		Salzburg, Munich, Strasbourg	2	47.801280, 13.044909	48.138509, 11.575579	48.579944, 7.750740											https://photos.app.goo.gl/KSPG9F3L2doTkxf16
Salzburg	Oktoberfest	108	x	The streets are narrow and there are loads of humans about. A lamb brat & beef brat with soft buns. An ivy covered church. A craft fair along the river. We purchase ceramic poppies for Anne. I get stuck by a spiny shrub. We lay a while on the bank of the river and I practice HDR photography. There is a group of refugees in the train station sitting and sleeping behind barricades. It is such a juxtoposition from the lighthearted joy of traveling to a new place to be so directly confronted with people who have had to leave their home out of fear. Part of a building is missing and it is beautiful. To Munich.	47.801280, 13.044909	Sep 20, 2015	Sep 20, 2015		Salzburg, Munich, Strasbourg	1	47.801280, 13.044909	48.138509, 11.575579	48.579944, 7.750740											https://photos.app.goo.gl/KSPG9F3L2doTkxf16
Tokyo	Wooed by	107	x	In no particular order: World-class coffee at Fuglen. Sky Tree in the misty night. We wait an hour to eat Tsukemen ramen underground in a metro station. Sweet crab treats from the conbini. Crunchy tempura. We mourn discarded umbrellas, soon to become karakasa. Yasuda makes us savory sushi with his knobby knuckled hands. Crispy katsukura in a skyscraper. Shabu shabu. A drunken two-mile walk at 2 a.m. to watch the tuna auction at Tsukiji. I buy whetstone.<br><br>Riding electric bicycles. Bar 5 turns us away. They don't give a reason, but our backpacks, t-shirts and shorts, plus being gaijin is the likely cause. We game in very loud arcades. The people playing here are serious business. Many have their own soft white gloves they bring to play the music tapping game. Mochi with bean paste. Custard in egg cups in underground Ginza. Crepes in Harajuku. Robots in Shinjuku. A parade in Meiji Jingu. We fall in love with Gudetama. We admire pearls in Mikimoto. We join the crowd at Senso-ji. Ukrainian lunch and a snow cone with Noriko. Super soft creamy soft serve. I buy risque manga in Akihabara.<br><br>Switch Coffee. Wagyu. Grilled chicken in Piss Alley. We attend a Kabuki performance and fall asleep for a bit. We drink lots of wine. Spend lots of time in the konbini. Takoyaki. Whisky at Star Bar. There Ryan asks for just Iberico fat, which he the proceeds to eat. L-Bar for cheap drinks. Ryan yells SUMIMASSEN!	35.665951, 139.720420	Aug 29, 2015	Sep 5, 2015	Ryan		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/FMgYKNq4QDUggrU88
San Marino	Inside Italy	106	x	San Marino is a nation on an small-ish, isolated mountain, which is entirely encircled by Italy. Before yesterday I didn't know this place existed. We drive up the mountain, park and begin exploring. The scenery (of Italy) is stunning and the company is superlative. Carpaccio and homemade pasta for lunch. There are quite a few shops selling pretend guns and imitation perfume. Bethany buys a small work from a man on the street painting canvases of buildings and flowers. Back to the villa where we eat leftovers for dinner.<br><br>Brigetta and Uwe spend a good amount of the day making food. They serve eggs and fruit for breakfast. We hang by the pool for a good while. We head to the store to buy cheese and more alcohol and then take family photos. The Nivens arrive. For dinner we have wine, turkey, tuna mayo, caprese salad, bruschetta, pesto pasta, strawberry cream cake, and two types of tiramisu. We take a few more photos and off we go. We sleep at airport. Martino—a Couchsurfer we hosted in London—is our security agent.<br><br>Straight into the office from the airport.	43.932693, 12.450015	Jun 29, 2015	Jun 29, 2015	Richard, Anne, Catherine, and Phoebe Miller, Bethany, Anne and Peter Niven, Brigetta and Uwe, Peggy, Connor, and Peggy's sister	Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	8	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Florence	Inside Italy	105	x	Today is a trip for only Liz and I. We don't do a lot in particular, but do a fiar bit of walking around. The sun is beating down and there are many tour groups out. Gelato, of course. Back to Arezzo, where we find Brigetta and Uwe have just arrived. Great lasagna for dinner.	43.769514, 11.255915	Jun 28, 2015	Jun 28, 2015		Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	7	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Volterra	Inside Italy	104	x	This town is a grid of small, tight, cobblestone streets. It feels a bit like walking around a Vegas interpretation of an Italian village. Lunch at a charming cafe of bresaola with melon, rocket, and mozzarella. We all go our own ways and shop a bit. I nearly buy an alabaster chess set. On the road back, we stop by a large red "O" overlooking a valley on the road To Sienna. We visit an dreamlike cathedral with frankensence-filled air. Peggy treats us all to dinner back in Arezzo. There  are too many appetizers. Many of the women kiss the waiter.	43.399269, 10.865400	Jun 27, 2015	Jun 27, 2015	Richard, Anne, Catherine, and Phoebe Miller, Bethany, Anne and Peter Niven, Peggy, Connor, and Peggy's sister	Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	6	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Cinque Terre	Inside Italy	103	x	We ride with Peggy and her fam. We barely made it onto the ferry to tour the five isolated beach towns. We get off at Monterosso to explore. Lunch is a nice fish stew and mussels pasta. We wander some more and of course have gelato. On our way back we stop by Pisa. While parking on the street a man acts as our 'parking attendant' and then wants money. We do what everyone does and take silly pictures in front of the tower. Back to villa for a lovely chicken parmesan made by Anne.	44.145904, 9.655338	Jun 26, 2015	Jun 26, 2015	Peggy, Connor, and Peggy's sister	Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	5	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
San Gimignano	Inside Italy	102	x	The tower is a sight to behold. Pizza. We sit at the top of the stairs in the sloping main square and eat gelato. Liz's vintage green beaded necklace snaps and send beads racing down across the piazza. We scramble to pick them up and somehow recover all but one bead. In a museum we gawk at renaissance babies. More gelato and then back to the villa for roast chicken dinner with baked potatoes made by Anne.	43.467365, 11.043581	Jun 24, 2015	Jun 24, 2015	Richard, Anne, Catherine, and Phoebe Miller, Bethany, Peggy, Connor, and Peggy's sister	Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	4	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Genoa	Inside Italy	101	x	Men are preaching in the streets. We walk for a while. We pass by the shipyard and then by an alley with at least one brothel in it. Lunch is cheap pasta. Onward to Milan. We attempt Bar Luce—which Wes Andersen designed—but a private event has it reserved for the evening. To Nottingham Forest, which is a was surreal and tacky cocktail bar. The menu is homemade—a binder with A4 Word doc sheets in plastic sleeves. We eat pizza and olives. Liz drinks a singing peach bellini and I Oysters (salt, leaves, campari). We share a Cloud (strawberry daiquiri) before beginning our drive back to Arezzo. On the drive we have a nice chat about early memories. At midnight it is our Anniversary. We sleep in a gas station.	44.404885, 8.935533	Jun 22, 2015	Jun 22, 2015		Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	3	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Arezzo	Inside Italy	100	x	Arezzo will act as our home base for the next seven days. The villa is smack in the middle of an active vineyard. Some days we will head out to various small town. Others we will relax here at the villa where we make meal, play ping pong, and drink plenty of wine. One day the daughter of the vineyards owner gives us a tour of the production facilities. While they make various wines here, their specialty is Vin Santo, a dessert wine made by hanging grapes from the rafters of the warehouse until the shrivel almost to rasins. Then, whatever little juice is left in them is squeezed out and fermented into what I can only describe as liquid nirvana. Over the course of the week we get to chat with, eat with, and travel with many lovely humans including Richard, Anne, Catherine, and Phoebe Miller, Bethany, Anne and Peter Niven, Brigetta and Uwe, Peggy, Connor, and Peggy's sister. One evening Liz, the young folks, and me make pizzas for everyone. Another evening Anne makes a superlative chicken parmesan. When Brigetta arrives she immedately sets about making enough angle hair pesto to feed at least thrice as many people as were present.	43.521617, 11.693873	Jun 21, 2015	Jun 30, 2015	Richard, Anne, Catherine, and Phoebe Miller, Bethany, Anne and Peter Niven, Brigetta and Uwe, Peggy, Connor, and Peggy's sister	Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	2	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.399269, 10.865400	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Rome	Inside Italy	99	x	We eat a nice sandwich and mini cannoli in the terminal. Our B&B is cute and simple. Out and to the Coliseum where the line isn't bad. Many men sell selfie sticks out front. Many others are dreesed in plastic gladiator costumes. We walk a lot. To the Pantheon. Gnocchi for dinner and then to Jerry Thomas Speakeasy for cocktails. Walking back in the dark we see many beautifully-lit, majestic fountains.<br><br>More cannoli and espresso at a cafe and then onto the Roman Forum. It is already very hot so we don't tarry. Lunch is a heavenly salmon, dill, and ricotta croissant from Crystal Sugar. We walk across cross the bridge to Travestera. The river is reminiscent of vintage green glass. We stop by a cafe for a cafe freddo then pick up some beers for later. To a liquor store for Cynar and Vivese. Quick stop for an Aperol Spritz. To Da Enzo for dinner. We start with fried squash blossoms. From there we are completely enamoured with our cacio e pepe and an umami packed rigatoni with tomato sauce & guanciale. This is without question the best Italian food I've ever had.<br><br>We get a rental car, stop by Crystal Sugar again for another salmon croissant, and leave the city. To Perugia. We walk up the hill and into the ancient city where we stroll the cobblestone streets and grab Gelato. Onward to Arezzo where we met the family at the villa. Dinner is sausages with wine.	41.888069, 12.477820	Jun 18, 2015	Jun 22, 2015		Rome, Perugia, Genoa, Milan, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Cinque Terra, Volterra, Siena, Florence, San Marino	1	41.888069, 12.477820	43.521617, 11.693873	44.404885, 8.935533	43.521617, 11.693873	43.467365, 11.043581	43.521617, 11.693873	44.145904, 9.655338	43.521617, 11.693873	43.521617, 11.693873	43.521617, 11.693873	43.769514, 11.255915	43.521617, 11.693873	43.932693, 12.450015	https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gE8wdLG5rh58x747
Worcester	Bees & Horse	98	x	We get a car and head straight to Shojo for Bok choy, kimchi fried rice, mushroom and pepper pasta ragu at Crouching Tiger. Then To Worchester for lovely humans and so many CATS. Kittens to be exact—cute, soft, smelly, scratchy, squeaky kittens. We relax at home with Kelly and Chris for a while and admire their vases. In the evening Kelly makes yummy cocktails.<br><br>To Trader Joe's and Target for supplies. Chris makes excellent waffles with maple syrup. Kenny comes over to hang for a bit and then we all head to Kelly's parents. Accents get thick quick. Liz & Kelly suit up for bees. I don't have a suit, but get close anyway and take lots of pictures. I don't get stung, but one chases me for a minute. I find the queen, which relieves Kelly since was worried she had killed previously. We all meet her uncle, Anne Frank, who is a nice guy. Next is cold brew, wraps, chips, and goodbyes. To Beverly. We arrive late for the rehearsal dinner. The humans are sweet, the gouda is great, and the lobster bisque magnificent. We stay at a nice hotel in downtown.<br><br>Some touching in the morning and then a Hazelnut paste latte followed by damn fine grilled cheese and kitchen sink quesadilla. Iguana, rattlesnake, lamb brains, cow liver, flunken. Let's Dance, Mozart, Emotional Rescue. To the wedding. Flower in the asphalt. Broken glass. In My Life. The flower girls drop their petals. Lamb lollipops. Met Beth. Tent. Toast. Falafel and Salmon. Dancing. Sweating. Cake. Dancing. Raising chairs. Dancing. Traveling. Sleeping. Traveling.	42.360887, -71.054206	Jun 5, 2015	Jun 8, 2015	Kelly & Chris	Paris, Massachusetts: Worcester, Boston	2	48.866204, 2.302153	42.360887, -71.054206												https://photos.app.goo.gl/CMwKVfgHdCy6bmkJ8
Paris	Bees & Horse	97	x	We take the red-eye bus from London to Paris and meet Alvin at his place in the morning. After a nap we head out. On the street we see two people without toes and a groovy horn band. We ride the metro to Père-Lachaise where we visit graves of Frédéric Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf, Oscar Wylde, and Georges Méliès. A man is peeing on the outer wall of the cemetery. Into Mariage Frères for some very fine loose-leaf tea and then to Experimental Cocktail Club for lovely cocktails. Dinner is a falafel shop where they make animal shapes from fruits and veggies. Liz got us tickets to Crazy Horse. The theatre is smaller than I expected. It is dim and hazy and there is a red candle on each table. The women's bodies are gorgeous, the acts were silly, and it was definitely quite cheesy at times. Sputnik, Upside Down, Scanners, Girl on a Horse, Girls with Horse Tails, Tap Dancing Men. Lots of pubic hair and red leather. Alvin awakes when we return. He tells us about his dreams of the war.<br><br>To Coutume for strong cold brew and a mushroomy woody Ethiopian. Next we visit Pâtisserie des Rêves for Pari-Brest. We take a film photobooth strip in Palais de Tokyo and work our way to Pompidou where we snack on pistachio ice cream and a crepe before heading 'inside'. There is a lot of trite modern art, but some quite good contemporary art. It boasts a great view of the city. We meet Alvin at Candelaria for expensive margaritas and great tacos. The chef is being very coy with me; Alvin thinks he has a thing for me. Next to Sherry Butt for fine drinks; mine has a smoky tomato liqueur in it. It is dark, but we walk around the Louvre exterior and along the Seine. A horn band is playing Thrift Shop. Alvin tells us about Paris Syndrome, which is when tourists are often let down by Paris upon visiting due to unrealistic expectations. We end the evening relaxing in his apartment and watch Blue Jasmine.<br><br>A quick stop for pastries and coffee from Telescope and then to the airport.	48.866204, 2.302153	Jun 2, 2015	Jun 5, 2015	Alvin	Paris, Massachusetts: Worcester, Boston	1	48.866204, 2.302153	42.360887, -71.054206												https://photos.app.goo.gl/CMwKVfgHdCy6bmkJ8
Haworth	VE Day	96	x	We leave London on the night bus and get in late to the hotel.<br><br>A greasy bacon butty and then the bus, which drops us off at a train station about a mile from Haworth. There is a beautiful steam locomotive sitting on the tracks. I'm not sure if it even runs, but we ride in a vintage double-decker up the hill. Though it's May, but open air is still quite chilly. We are in Haworth, which truly feels like stepping back in time. People are dressed in impeccable 40's panoply. The shops mostly sell Britain-themed clothing or memorabilia. There are also many stalls selling the same and also food. There is a pristine Spitfire on display. We buy milk powder for the bath. Next we stop in a pub for bitter ale and chips. Afterward we visit a small Alan Turing museum where we see an Enigma, a German enciphering machine, and the Bombe, a deciphering proto-computer he invented. Then we have a sausage with cream tea. Later, we watched couples dance to a live swing band in the tent. As evening sets in we head to Bradford. We don't feel comfortable here and we can't find condoms. We eat chicken at Nando's. There's a fight outside. A man in the lift reminds us of Dracula.<br><br>A man at the bus stop Just. Keeps. Spitting. We eat bread and salami. And then sat in the grass for a cream tea. We take the steam train north. I chat with a nice older Irish man. Liz sits next to a young boy who she says smells like sugar. His hands are sticky and he repeatedly touches her skirt. I get a cask cream ale at the station before we return to London.	53.831466, -1.955800	May 15, 2015	May 16, 2015		Haworth, Bradford, Leeds	1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/5XPKh3TbcD5XV6Mn9
Apeldoorn	Tulips & Cocktails	95	x	We pick up cheese, meat, and beer from the store before driving to Apeldoorn. We arrive at the hotel, shower, touch, and nap. We are feeling uninspired by dinner options so we snack on bitterballen and kasstangles in the hotel bar then proceed to drink beer in the room.<br><br>We drive down through the green areas on the map. This is Amsterdam's largest forest. It is pretty and very manicured.	52.211208, 5.972079	May 4, 2015	May 5, 2015		Amsterdam, Alkmaar, Haarlem, Den Hague, Apeldoorn	4	52.369138, 4.887428	52.631723, 4.758982	52.369138, 4.887428	52.083546, 4.314128	52.369138, 4.887428	52.211208, 5.972079								https://photos.app.goo.gl/3eJzzHckUEwY2nVZ9
Den Haag	Tulips & Cocktails	94	x	I almost back into a server (restaurant, not beep boop). He kindly yelled at me before I hit him. Our main stop here is the M.C. Escher Museum, where we spend hours learning just how much of a master and genius Escher was. We both are in awe at the beauty and ingenuity of his vast body of work. Next we head to Keukenhof, a massive flower garden with over 7 million flowers; nearly all of them tulips. We spend hours taking in seemingly endless varieties of tulips. I take A LOT of pictures. We drive back to Amsterdam and try for our favorite fondue place, but they close up just as we arrive. We get cheap falafel instead. To Tales & Spirits again where we drink a Zombie, a Bathtub, and more. We wander the red lights and arrive at Hiding in Plain Sight where we take in a rum punch and a citron brûlée flip. We sleep in the car again.	52.083546, 4.314128	May 3, 2015	May 4, 2015		Amsterdam, Alkmaar, Haarlem, Den Hague, Apeldoorn	3	52.369138, 4.887428	52.631723, 4.758982	52.369138, 4.887428	52.083546, 4.314128	52.369138, 4.887428	52.211208, 5.972079								https://photos.app.goo.gl/3eJzzHckUEwY2nVZ9
Alkmaar	Tulips & Cocktails	93	x	We hoped to catch the cheese market, but it is closing up just as we arrive. We stroll the town, and buy a vase for Catherine. Next we head to Haarlem for groceries and chocolate milk before returning to Amsterdam. We park for the evening and take a cab to Tales & Spirits. Our cab driver is clearly taking us the long way. I call him out and he complains for a while before offering a discount. The bar is small, lively, and charming. They serve one drink in a small bathtub. We order a Bird is the Word and Smoke and Mirrors; both are incredible. We sleep in the car on the side of the road near the library.<br><br>Up and to Den Hague.	52.631723, 4.758982	May 1, 2015	May 2, 2015		Amsterdam, Alkmaar, Haarlem, Den Hague, Apeldoorn	2	52.369138, 4.887428	52.631723, 4.758982	52.369138, 4.887428	52.083546, 4.314128	52.369138, 4.887428	52.211208, 5.972079								https://photos.app.goo.gl/3eJzzHckUEwY2nVZ9
Amsterdam	Tulips & Cocktails	92	x	We have some difficulty figuring out the buses into the city. We get a car from a very hip car rental agency. Liz drives, but becomes quickly frustrated driving around Amsterdam. We get lunch from Signel 404 and eat on the canal bank just across the street. One sandwich is warm goat cheese with pine nuts, thyme, and honey. The other is 'Old Cheese', walnuts, sun-dried tomatoes, and honey mustard. We hit the road towards Alkmaar. I drive for the rest of the trip.	52.369138, 4.887428	Apr 30, 2015	May 1, 2015		Amsterdam, Alkmaar, Haarlem, Den Hague, Apeldoorn	1	52.369138, 4.887428	52.631723, 4.758982	52.369138, 4.887428	52.083546, 4.314128	52.369138, 4.887428	52.211208, 5.972079								https://photos.app.goo.gl/3eJzzHckUEwY2nVZ9
Cambridge	Sushi and Tiki in	91	x	We take an early train from London. Just outside the station we tour a mock court house populated by disturbing mannequins. We walk a lot. We stop in front of the University and Liz makes us sandwiches. We stop for coffee and watch bird. We get into campus and but have a difficult time finding our way out again. We eat sushi from a conveyor belt and head to Lola Lo, a 'Tiki Bar', which is definitely not a tiki bar. I think we've seen at least five hen parties today. Back at the station a bride to be is asleep on the platform.	52.210604, 0.123076	Apr 11, 2015	Apr 11, 2015			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/ApTYwFVJfFUEzgsa8
Antwerp	Marionettes & Comedy	90	x	Today is Easter, which means this town is shut down. We manage to find a waffle with liqueur ice cream. Then we walk around the sleep city. We come upon a quaint park and sit on the bench facing the lake for a while. For the first time, we discuss the possibility of not having children. Before now, we had always assumed we would. Now, we don't assume. We eat pizza & pasta, get a beer and spent a while trying to find our Megabus stop.	51.220752, 4.400973	Apr 5, 2015	Apr 6, 2014		Gent, Brussels, Antwerp	3	51.209708, 3.226056	50.848588, 4.348293	51.220752, 4.400973											https://photos.app.goo.gl/UEtqndWh8AsTRNFA6
Brussels	Marionettes & Comedy	89	x	We stop by Melvin & Alexia's and shortly head out to the Magritte Museum, which is not a pipe. Back at the flat they make a roast chicken dinner. Back out again to Goupil Le Fol for sweet gin drinks with odd flavors and old French music in a large Bohemian house. Our next stop is Toone, a marionette theater and beer bar, where we drink and play card games.<br><br>We head out to a local square which is acting as a thrift and antique market today. Melvin buys glass jars. At the corner of the square is a small brasserie, where we sit in the sun and have sandwiches and beers. Liz and I pickup chocolates for Alix. Back at the flat they make us a quiche.<br><br>Melvin makes us pancakes with our names written on them in batter before we take the train to Antwerp.	50.848588, 4.348293	Apr 3, 2015	Apr 5, 2015	Melvin & Alexia	Gent, Brussels, Antwerp	2	51.209708, 3.226056	50.848588, 4.348293	51.220752, 4.400973											https://photos.app.goo.gl/UEtqndWh8AsTRNFA6
Bruges	Marionettes & Comedy	88	x	We take the night bus from London. Didier has coffee and pastries waiting for us. Afterward he is busy and we go to Bruges. It is pretty, but also touristy and cold. It takes us a while to find an ATM and then a non-touristy lunch place. We walk a lot. Liz chats with an orange cat that ran over to say hello. Back to Gent. We grab a quick Kebab and then see Didier perform stand-up comedy in English (for us) in a bar.<br><br>Didier has quiche waiting for us when we, finally, wake up. We hang a while and head for tomato soup with a croque madame at a shop near his place. We drink a lot of good beer, walk a lot, stop for a hot chocolate, and listen to an accordionist play near a cathedral. Didier makes good schnitzel and carrots for dinner.

Austin	Two Weddings	86	x	Breakfast is Biscuits and Groovy, which is groovy. Houndstooth for coffee. Liz was hoping to get a mani before the wedding, but we aren't able to squeeze one in. We borrow Anthony's car, stop by Chicken Express, and make our way to Ryan & Amy's wedding. We arrive to what looks like a movie set for an old western. The road is dirt. There are a few small shops and a chapel. The bridesmaids are in peach. Ryan is wearing a Pee-Wee Herman suit. The ceremony is fucking sweet. The recessional is to General Public's Tenderness. Dinner is good Southern food.<br><br>Back in Austin, we ride bikes with Anthony a bit before he takes us to a big graffiti complex. I accidentally tear my pants; naturally we take a picture. To Boardwalk for kimchi fries and a Monte Cristo. Home for a quick nap and then to a garden party where some nice folks grill tortillas over an open flame and teach me about Sandor Katz. We round off the night with drinks and dinner at Odd Duck.<br><br>Jamaican food truck breakfast and a quick show at Mohawk. Next we head to Red 7 for Destruction Unit and free hot dogs.<br><br>Liz heads back to Dallas for work. I get a burger at Cherrywood and attend the premier of Krisha, a very cool film Ryan Booth pulled focus on. Whole Foods and then a locals only show at Empire for Whisky Shivers, Mother Falcon, and Golden Dawn Arkestra. It is a blast.<br><br>I wake up, get tacos and coffee. Shortly I head to the Italian food truck for Cacio e pepe and drink. In the evening I go with Anthony and Cheyenne to a secret show under a bridge where I meet Heather and her friend. We hang a bit and then I split to Liberty bar to meet back with Anthony.	30.307201, -97.980408	Mar 12, 2015	Mar 19, 2015	Ryan & Amy, Anthony	Austin, Denver	1	30.307201, -97.980408	39.753156, -105.000266												https://photos.app.goo.gl/vQgWPNgirMYGkvqq7

Chicago	New Year	81	x	Bret picks us up, takes his to his swanky apartment in the loop, and we watch Kathy Griffin and Anderson Cooper on TV. After a bit of that we walk to some famous Chicago pizza place for garlic sauce and very delicious, very buttery deep dish pizza. I eat two slices and am stuffed. It is 18° out and I don't think I've ever felt colder. I see a girl hop out of a cab wearing a short dress with bare legs. We drink some wine and walk out to Navy Pier to watch the fireworks.<br><br>Pizza for breakfast, followed by Intelligentsia for coffee. We walk to the ice ribbon and skate. I am having a blast, Liz is doing pretty well, and Bret is holding onto the wall. We clean up and head to ..._ for yummy drinks and cool tiki mugs. After individual rounds we share a scorpion bowl.<br><br>Breakfast at a knockoff French Cafe and then to a big Macy's for earmuffs. Bret takes us to the suburbs for hot dogs at Superdawg before he drops us at the airport.	41.891739, -87.607260	Dec 31, 2014	Jan 2, 2015	Bret		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/62LXGXRaMzGkhN1r6
Montreal	Foie Gras, Mostly	80	x	Liz, Ryan, and I land and immediately head downtown to Schwartz's Deli for pastrami with yellow mustard on white bread. It is clean and smoky. A few doors down and we stop by Au Kouign Amann for a slice of kouign amann. I think it is better as an individual unit rather than a sliced pie. Another couple doors down to Cortado for very viscous hot chocolate. We stop by the B&B to relax a bit and get ready for the big night. We catch a ride to the Little Burgundy neighborhood and head to<span class="list__container menu"><span class="list__title">Liverpool House</span><span class="list__item">We immediately meet Dave McMillan and express our gratitude.

Once or twice, he leans back and bumps into Liz. He grabs a bottle of champagne and a large knife, then proceeds to whack the top of the bottle off into the bowels of the kitchen. He takes a drink from the broken bottle and pours some into the mouths of his chefs. We greet him, tell him our story, and gave our praise. He is pleased by our tale and gives us a round of Christmas shots followed by pear brandy. Ryan asks if he will get him reservations to the Sugar Shack. He tells Ryan he will get them if Ryan sucks his dick. We walk slowly back to the B&B where we let all of the fat and sugar settle in a bit before getting up early and heading straight to the airport.	45.522309, -73.574370	Dec 17, 2014	Dec 18, 2014	Ryan		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/xiFC9RQNetumptEV6
Manhattan	Explorers	79		We arrive at Jon and Allison's and spend a good while catching up and playing with their animals. They take us out for Manhattan (the big one) style pizza and give us a tour of the little apple.<br><br>Allison makes us bacon, coffee, and ebelskiver. We head out. She gives us a quick campus tour before Liz and I head east. We stop at PT's for very good coffee in Topeka. Allison is in Kansas City for the day, so we meet her at a Mexican restaurant, drink some coffee at Quay, and spend a few hours in a four-story antique shop where I find an LP of Exile on Main St.	39.179459, -96.560428	Dec 13, 2014	Dec 14, 2014	Allison & Jon	Kansas City, Chanute, Manhattan	3	39.044546, -94.620173	37.683244, -95.452132	39.179459, -96.560428											https://photos.app.goo.gl/Lgyub1Fw8knjBxB56
Chanute	Explorers	78	x	We spend a few hours exploring the Martin & Osa Johnson Safari Museum. They were a husband and wife team of filmmakers/authors who did a lot of exploring in the early twentieth century. This museum houses many of their possessions and information about their lives.	37.683244, -95.452132	Dec 13, 2014	Dec 13, 2014	Allison & Jon	Kansas City, Chanute, Manhattan	2	39.044546, -94.620173	37.683244, -95.452132	39.179459, -96.560428											https://photos.app.goo.gl/Lgyub1Fw8knjBxB56
Kansas City	Explorers	77		We land, rent a Fiat, and drive to Joe's Kansas City BBQ.

Houston	Texas Is It	76	x	We drive to Howard and Angela's house in Katy. They show us their cats, share some drinks, feed us Chinese and Indonesian. We spend the evening catching up and it is wonderful.<br><br>Galveston is a lot further from Katy than I realized. We get there and discover the overpriced pier we decide we don't need to see up close. Onward to Houston. A homeless man on the sidewalk is peeing directly into traffic. We drive by astonished and make brief eye contact. We decide we aren't feeling Houston so we get a coffee, eat at Red Robin, and drive home.	29.296275, -94.918385	Nov 25, 2014	Nov 26, 2014	Howard & Angela	Waco, Austin, Fredericksburg, San Antonio, Katy, Galveston, Houston	4	30.232550, -97.999515	31.803311, -97.099638	29.413789, -98.490241	29.296275, -94.918385										https://photos.app.goo.gl/m7uD8HrsNFemhTBC7
San Antonio	Texas Is It	75	x	We have an annual pass to Six Flags, so we go there and ride some great rides. I get hit with spit in the face by a kid who doesn't understand the physics of the chair swing. Dinner is at Hot Joy for great double miso ramen and spam fried rice. Later we stroll along the riverwalk, have a peek at the Alamo, and then sleep in the back of the Kia very uncomfortably.<br><br>We both stink. We get some coffee. I try to find flowers to bring to Grandma & Grandpa's graves, but this part of town is desolate. When we arrive at the cemetery I first ask to visit them alone. I sit by them and cry a lot. I realize how deeply I love and miss them. After a bit I ask Liz to join me. I cry a lot more. We spend a little while there and I share a few favorite memories — like the special smell of heir van, eating the saccharine honey buns, the above ground pool on the lawn with thicker grass blades than we have in Arizona, lightning bugs, Tex-Mex, Grandpa falling asleep to the golf channel, driving around to look at houses, going to the BX, grocery bags with gas station snacks for Justin and me, brushing my teeth along with Grandma, and of course drinking lots of wine at Batista's. We say goodbye and head to El Mercado where we eat Rosarios for lunch. Liz gets a slice of pie with ice cream on top; she asks if everything in this town is a-la-mode. Damnit I love you. Then we tour the Alamo.	29.413789, -98.490241	Nov 23, 2014	Nov 25, 2014	Ken & Frankie	Waco, Austin, Fredericksburg, San Antonio, Katy, Galveston, Houston	3	30.232550, -97.999515	31.803311, -97.099638	29.413789, -98.490241	29.296275, -94.918385										https://photos.app.goo.gl/m7uD8HrsNFemhTBC7

Austin	Texas Is It	73	x	We drive to Anthony's place. He takes us to Jester King, in the hill country, for some weird beers featuring salt and mushroom. A bad storm suddenly rolls in bringing intense thunder and swimming pools of rain. It's pretty scary and we worry for a bit that we might get flooded out, but we make it back to town safely. We head to Taco More for goat soup, a quesadilla, lengua tacos, and horchata. Then to Ryan & Amy's for the evening.<br><br>They provide coffee, kolaches, and Twilight Zone for breakfast. We drive to Fredericksburg. I text Uncle Mike but he says he's busy. Many shops are closed and we're not really feeling it so we head back before long and get some good pizza. Liz and I head to meet Gian, Allison, and Sinjin at Whole Foods and then hang at their place for a bit. Sinjin plays the drum kit for us. Back to Anthony's for a Thanksgiving potluck. During charades someone picks Anthony's butthole.<br><br>Brew n' Brew and Biscuits and Groovy, antiques, and then we hit the road.	30.232550, -97.999515	Nov 22, 2014	Nov 23, 2014	Anthony, Ryan & Amy, Gian, Allison, Sinjin	Waco, Austin, Fredericksburg, San Antonio, Katy, Galveston, Houston	1	30.232550, -97.999515	31.803311, -97.099638	29.413789, -98.490241	29.296275, -94.918385										https://photos.app.goo.gl/m7uD8HrsNFemhTBC7
St. Louis	City Museum	72	x	We head downtown and eat a BBQ Cuban sandwich. To The Arch. In the line we meet John, a kind man who is retired and who travels the world. The elevator looks designed by Kubrick. The windows at the top are tiny. The view is nice. Down and out, we pass a hip hop dance class in the park. We walk to the City Museum, which is a lot like a massive Discovery Zone, but for adults and with some learning. We see a cat skeleton, slide down many slides (including a ten-story slide), climb through fake caves, and snack on roasted marshmallows. We also split a root beer float then met Signe and Brittany, our Couchsurfing hosts. They take us out for tacos at a restaurant where Signe's sister works. They bring us somewhere else for more drinks where we chat a while and then head to bed.<br><br>We head to a cafe for a muffin with an egg inside. Signe drives us around a forest park. It is too cold to get out and explore. She drives us to the airport and we say goodbye.	38.633884, -90.200334	Nov 15, 2014	Nov 16, 2014	Signe, Brittany, Ava		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/txWtE9Wuh6MbUYbb9
Arkansas	Mining	71	x	We land in Little Rock,  rent a car, and drive to Crater of Diamonds park. We spend a few hours chatting and digging in the dirt. We find some tiny things that aren't diamonds.

Valparaiso	Chile	70	x	We don't really know what to do here so we just walk for a while. There is a lot of street art. This city is hilly and colorful. I am reminded of the Bay Area. We eat empanadas and ride ascensors to get up the hills. A quaint shop catches our eye, so we stop for coffee and ice cream. We come upon a very steep hill with a long, heavily graffitied staircase. I later find out this is called the Happy Hippy street. We climb the stairs. Halfway up, Liz meets a cat that really wants to cuddle. Liz does not seem to mind. At the top of the hill we find a nice looking restaurant where we eat sashimi.<br><br>We buy a photo of an ascensor. The print method is very esoteric and manual. More sashimi. There is a large flower box on the ground with a boy crawling inside of it. As we pass a fruit stand, one older man boots his friend in the butt, but when he makes contact his friend doesn't budge and he falls backwards.	-33.046994, -71.612767	Oct 20, 2014	Oct 22, 2014		Santiago, Valparaiso	2	-33.423892, -70.633521	-33.046994, -71.612767												https://photos.app.goo.gl/qBwB4bhay4zZujjbA
Santiago	Chile	69	x	To Bar Nacional for a couple of nice stews. Next we try pisco sours at El Diablito before calling it a night. <br><br>Mercado Mariscos for seafood. We want to catch a flight to Rapa Nui, but it's not in the cards. Instead we have tasty salmon sashimi and hike Cerro San Cristobal. Be both get hot and lie at the bottom of the hill under a tree. We find a well-rated ramen place for dinner.	-33.423892, -70.633521	Oct 17, 2014	Oct 20, 2014		Santiago, Valparaiso	1	-33.423892, -70.633521	-33.046994, -71.612767												https://photos.app.goo.gl/qBwB4bhay4zZujjbA
Seattle	Big Trouble in Little	68	x	The boys pick us up. Anthony and I will ride in the back of Sean's truck throughout the trip. He will moon Liz and Sean in the cab numerous times. To Montana for pickle backs and some other tasty concoctions. We whisper at Sean's home to not wake his roommates.<br><br>French toast and strawberry flavored donuts with Stumptown coffee for breakfast. To a vegan diner and then the coffee shop Sean's roommate works at. She sits out back with us for a bit because a 'fuckboi' inside was harassing her. We book shop. I get The Delicate Prey and some pulp Sci-Fi. Next is antique, blanket, record shopping. I get Aja and Pirates of Penzance. Sean is very excite to take us to this Cuban sandwich shop where we eat marinated pork shoulder, fat caramelized onions, garlic aioli, and romaine on fresh baguettes. He wasn't lying, these are fantastic. We buy some beers do drink back at his place.<br><br>Donuts and coffee again. Around the lake we find big spiders and toxic algae. For lunch we head to a Thai kitchen for Pad See Ewe and a few other delights. This too is just unbelievably good. I will spend years chasing the joy of that first Pad See Ewe. Anthony and I take selfies in the truck bed on the freeway.	47.658760, -122.349334	Oct 3, 2014	Oct 5, 2014	Sean, Anthony		1														
Salt Lake City	Salty Times in	67	x	Katy and Michael are waiting for us at Bar-X. We have some very good drinks, eat sausage, and chat about sign painting. Katy takes us to The Rest, and underground bar below an arcade bar. Our server smells of ambrosia. Liz is smitten. She sits down at our table and does a shot with us.<br><br>Katy and Michael take us to Gilgal Sculpture Garden, which is an absolute hidden gem. There is a Sphinx with Joseph Smith's face. This place feels like an LDS LSD themed mini-golf course without the mini golf. We all meet John, Jen, and Penny for a brunch of lemon cream french toast. We leave with John & Jen's to their place, where we meet their boys and some other family. We smell oils, check out rockets, drink cacao, and catch up. We try for Korean restaurant, but it is closed so we opt for Thai instead.	40.758739, -111.869421	Sep 26, 2014	Sep 28, 2014	Katy Willis & Michael, John, Jen and Penny		1														
New Orleans	24 Hours	66	x	Liz read about a nice grocery store in the French Quarter, so we head there first and down some Muffuletta sandwiches. Some high school kids are doing a drum line routine while marching down the street. They are incredible. To Cafe du Monde for lots of powdered sugar on beignets and chicory coffee. We ride a street car to our B&B, which we learn has been converted from former slaves' quarters. We nap. Carousel Bar is one of the famous establishements in town, so we head there for what turn out to be unimpressive cocktails. Dinner is at a much cooler restaurant with a rocking jukebox. We eat rabbit jambalaya and lamb ribs. To Bourbon street. Liz buys Catherine "carpe the fuck out of this diem" socks from the Hustler store. We catch a drag show at the end of the street.<br><br>Omelette and cereal. We stroll through the Garden District, grab a coffee, and explore Lafayette Cemetery No. 1. There is a cute cat sleeping on the steps of a mausoleum. We talk about ghosts. More beignets and some window shopping in the FQ. To Sazerac Bar for an incredible Ramos Gin Fizz, which they shake for nearly five minutes, and a Sazerac. Eats a greasy shrimp Po' Boy and leaves.	29.954046, -90.072399	Sep 21, 2014	Sep 22, 2014			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/5gTSfWLE6QLs3AdDA
Austin	Franklin	65	x	We stop by Sonic on the way to Franklin. After 5 hours of waiting in line we order brisket, sausage, turkey, pickles, onions, white bread, espresso BBQ sauce, and beer. It is good, but not so much better than the many other very good BBQ places around. We wade in the water at Barton springs before heading back to his place for a nap. In the evening Anthony leaves for a work party and we head to Mohawk for a Ska marching band and Golden Dawn Arkestra.	30.270378, -97.731294	Aug 22, 2014	Aug 23, 2014	Anthony		1

A few hours later we pick up Liz and head to his and Sara's place for pasta.<br><br>A banana sandwich and coffee on the terrace. We ride the train downtown with Sara and explore the white buildings, trolley cars, golden gate, and steep hills. To the water. Louis gives us a telephone-guided tour of the area. Some men are selling fake pot. Lunch is a vegetarian buffet. We ride the Santa Justa Lift and take in the view. We see a skeletal cathedral, Peruvian statues, and mummified children. Next we ride the long loop on trolley #28. It winds down tiny streets with hundreds of variations on decorative tiles. A grandmother leans out her window to hang whites. Burgers inside an old trolley car for dinner followed by ping pong at the rec center.<br><br>We get groceries at Jumbo and head to the beach. Louis drives us into the mountains where we picnic, hike, climb boulders, and throw the frisbee. To Sintsa for eggy treats and espresso. To a choppy beach. We take cute pictures and had almond & passion fruit sorbet in Cascuis. Coconut for them. Meat pasta. Terminator. Five games of ping pong and one game of chess.<br><br>Louis picks up a pastry for us at the train station and then we start flying.	38.728876, -9.139262	Jul 16, 2014	Jul 20, 2014	Louis, Sara, Boris, Boon, Frederika	Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Swanley, Kent, London, Lisbon	8	55.862814, -4.231565	55.945234, -3.161918	53.235334, -0.541422	51.402663, 0.178645	51.381391, -2.360411	51.179117, -1.826183	51.503108, 0.002963	38.728876, -9.139262						https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbYseiG74h64RCfv7

We head back to her apartment to catch up a bit, but we fall asleep on her couch. To Monmouth for coffee before we meet Robert for drinks. He is an excellent conversationalist and tells us of secret tube lines, underground bunkers in London, monkey meat, Grandpa Miller's suspected activities, and both Great Plagues. Next is pizza with Fran, Hattie, and her squeeze.<br><br>To Cream Tea in Clapham. Next to SOHO for Golden Union fish & chips and shopping.

Bath	Peat, Python, Ping Pong	61	x	Helen meets us at the main station in Bath and tour the eponymous abbey. All of the decomposing bodies buried under the church are causing the floors to buckle. A women's choir performs. The organ looks like the Mouth of Sauron. In the square we snack on Jaffa Cake ice cream. Some retired looking folk are having a Boules tournament. We've seen at least three hen parties.	51.381391, -2.360411	Jul 12, 2014	Jul 12, 2014	Helen	Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Swanley,Bath, Stonehenge, London, Lisbon	5	55.862814, -4.231565	55.945234, -3.161918	53.235334, -0.541422	51.402663, 0.178645	51.381391, -2.360411	51.179117, -1.826183	51.503108, 0.002963	38.728876, -9.139262						https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbYseiG74h64RCfv7
Swanley	Peat, Python, Ping Pong	60	x	From Lincoln we take a train to Swanley. Elaine picks us up at the station. We catch up at the house over tea before heading to dinner at The Castle. We all snack on fondue with bread and crispy sweet glazed ham bits. Liz gets a grand bowl of mussels and now I know what pork hoc is. Back at the house David and Elaine share stories of travels aboard Norwegian ships and South African trains. We drink Amarula and Chivas Regal.	51.402663, 0.178645	Jul 11, 2014	Jul 12, 2014	David & Elaine	Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Swanley,Bath, Stonehenge, London, Lisbon	4	55.862814, -4.231565	55.945234, -3.161918	53.235334, -0.541422	51.402663, 0.178645	51.381391, -2.360411	51.179117, -1.826183	51.503108, 0.002963	38.728876, -9.139262						https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbYseiG74h64RCfv7
Lincoln	Peat, Python, Ping Pong	59	x	I fall asleep in the back of Jane Bauer's SUV while she and Liz buy groceries. I dream of being attacked by spiders. I wake up to find two little eight-eyed creatures hanging out with me. I search for bites. Jane lives on a large property that I would call a farm, though she likely wouldn't. She is caring. In her farm are dogs, cats, pigs,hogs, chickens, and foster humans, seagulls, hedgehogs and a duck. The town is quaint. The church is tall. For dinner Jane makes us mustard seed chicken, strawberries, and sticky toffee pudding.<br><br>In the morning she makes us a delicious Full English Breakfast. I take pictures of their kitten. This is the first time in my life where I feel like I am taking Good™ pictures.	53.235334, -0.541422	Jul 10, 2014	Jul 11, 2014	Jane Bauer	Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Swanley,Bath, Stonehenge, London, Lisbon	3	55.862814, -4.231565	55.945234, -3.161918	53.235334, -0.541422	51.402663, 0.178645	51.381391, -2.360411	51.179117, -1.826183	51.503108, 0.002963	38.728876, -9.139262						https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbYseiG74h64RCfv7
Edinburgh	Peat, Python, Ping Pong	58	x	We take the train to meet Chris, Amy, and Ruby (their dog) at their house. We go to Urban Angel for fennel soup and sandwiches. I drink an Ardbeg flight before climbing the big staircase up to the Royal Mile. We wander the Mile where we learn about whisky and the referendum. We drink Cocktails at Bramble and join Chris and Amy for dinner at Burger Meats Bun. Back at their house we watch Germany beat Brazil 7-1.<br><br>Tea and biscuits dipped in chocolate is breakfast. We ride the bus and hike up to Arthur's Chair. Liz naps on the side of the mountain. Back down we buy clotted cream fudge and Iron Bru from a gift shop. For dinner Amy makes an excellent Burmese fish curry and we watch a less memorable football match.	55.945234, -3.161918	Jul 8, 2014	Jul 10, 2014	Chris & Amy	Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Swanley,Bath, Stonehenge, London, Lisbon	2	55.862814, -4.231565	55.945234, -3.161918	53.235334, -0.541422	51.402663, 0.178645	51.381391, -2.360411	51.179117, -1.826183	51.503108, 0.002963	38.728876, -9.139262						https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbYseiG74h64RCfv7
Glasgow	Peat, Python, Ping Pong	57	x	The first local I encounter upon disembarking from the plane is the customs officer, who I find incomprehensible. I see at least three women wearing parachute pants within 20 minutes. We take a bus to St. George Square and then explore the Necropolis. Crumbling statues. Trash in mausoleums. I learn about tablet and we get some in ice cream. We head to Tiki Bar & Kitsch Inn for some drinks and Foosball.<br><br>Haggis. Floating heads, Christ suspended, coffee, organ music, and a barnacle dick at the Kelvingrove Museum. Mother India. The Transport Museum for trains, a big, green couch, and my first 99. A vary talented BMX cyclist is hopping on a fire hydrant. We meet Hope and John at the bell tower, which is where they used to publicly execute prisoners. We head to Meat Bar for cocktails with meat in them. To the house for hot chocolate, spiced gin, and good vinyl.	55.862814, -4.231565	Jul 6, 2014	Jul 8, 2014	Hope & John	Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Swanley,Bath, Stonehenge, London, Lisbon	1	55.862814, -4.231565	55.945234, -3.161918	53.235334, -0.541422	51.402663, 0.178645	51.381391, -2.360411	51.179117, -1.826183	51.503108, 0.002963	38.728876, -9.139262						https://photos.app.goo.gl/HbYseiG74h64RCfv7
Sacramento	Vehicles	56	x	We can't catch a flight to Sacramento, so we opt for a Greyhound. Our driver asks if anyone want to stop for a break. A woman shouts "I ain't showered in two days". We don't stop. A (different) woman, with probably schizophrenia, is sitting behind me. I hear regular spells of muffled cursing and crying. I feel her hit my seat. I don't turn around. Dad & Barb make us dinner and jam for a while. We head off in the morning.	38.747670, -121.289877	Jul 4, 2014	Jul 5, 2014	Dad & Barb	Reno, Sacramento	2	39.310875, -119.649348	38.747670, -121.289877												https://photos.app.goo.gl/QzEMvHNpZz5F39cZ8
Reno	Vehicles	55	x	We meet Mom and Jim. Mom makes us rumchatas in the hotel room before we head downstairs to check out the classic car show. The Righteous Brothers are performing. They sound pretty good. We go to an after party for a wedding which Jim had officiated. We return to our favorite sushi buffet in Reno. We lose at roulette and head home in the morning.	39.310875, -119.649348	Jul 1, 2014	Jul 4, 2014	Mom & Jim	Reno, Sacramento	1	39.310875, -119.649348	38.747670, -121.289877												https://photos.app.goo.gl/QNWVZQsLU5xnCUdQ7
Medellín	Cable Cars	54	x	One of Medellín's top attractions is a few-mile long cable car which ends at a large park. This is my first to-do. I board the car in the middle of the city, at the bottom of the valley. The car goes up the side of the mountain, over favelas, and across the hills. In thirty minutes I am at Arvi Park. I get lulo juice and grilled mushrooms from a street vendor and then proceed to wander through manicured and paved mountain trails for a couple of hours. I get some fresh fruit with yogurt from another cart vendor. On my way back, I get off at the favela station halfway down the mountain. It is festive, lively, colorful. I get looks from locals that seem to inform me this is not the place for tourists. I head to El Poblado, a place meant for tourists. I eat a bad carne fajita cone from a clean corporate fast food restaurant. I want to hear some live music. I find a group, but they are busking directly to couples on the street and mostly interested in tips. A man wearing nearly twenty stacked hats follows in their wake, hoping to capitalize off of the festive spirit the musicians bring. I find a rock cover band playing the Cranberries "Zombie" at a bar. I stay and have what I hope is Calamari.<br><br>Hostel breakfast and then to Plaza Botero. An older, vagrant man has a small crowd around him. I'm not sure if he is an entertainer, a preacher, or mentally ill. He takes a lit cigarette and places it into a toy gorilla's mouth. Next he makes tubes by rolling up paper. He takes out a razor blade, demonstrates that it is very sharp by slicing up pieces of newspaper with it, and then runs it along his neck and the palm of his hand. It doesn't part his skin. He then unbuttons his shirt to reveal his nipple, which is pierced with a safety pin. Hanging from the pin is a small cloth bag. He opens it, which contains a few diamond shaped black pebbles. He lifts up a cup of what looks like water with food coloring in it. He places the stones in the water. They absorb all of the color, turning the water clear. I can't read the expressions of the faces of the crowd, but none of them look as confused as I surely do. I leave. In the museum, I take in the beauty of the voluminous Botero figures. I walk to Pergamino where I have a tasty coffee and watched the fútbol game with a room of about 60 people. Colombia wins. The streets are a joyous party for the rest of the evening. Vendors are selling all sorts of noise makers, hats, and canisters filled with foam to spray. There is foam everywhere. Lots of chanting.<br><br>A 13 year-old kid drives me to the airport.

Bogota	Cable Cars	53	x	It is late. I take a cab to hostel. I see a man in military garb standing on the street corner, holding a large gun.<br><br>It is a bit rainy, but I take a bike tour with about ten other tourists. We are going down a wet hill when my tires slip from under me. I catch myself with one leg, but I tear the ass of my pants wide open. We ride through lots of scary traffic. We stop in a fruit market and sugar up. There is a lot of good graffiti all over town. We stop by a children's cemetery turned public park. The university. A band of pickpockets. A coffee roaster. A bullfighting arena. There is a statue of a famous matador out front; he has a massive bulge. All over town people are setting up for the World Cup where tonight Colombia will play against Bolivia. It is a big deal. I buy new pants and walk to Plaza Bolivar to watch Colombia play in the cup. This plaza is packed. There is a live projection of the game onto the side of a building. It is the most enjoyable sporting experience I have ever been a part of. There are men and women with carts selling all sorts of things. I get a sweet tea and a hot dog. Someone brought a llama.<br><br>It is rainy. I eat masa y queso cake and walk to Monserrate, a mountain peak on one side of town with a curch at the top. I take the cable car up. It is cold, foggy, and majestic. I come down and head to Tabula. While drinking a Negroni at the bar, Tomas comes out to give me dining advice. I accept all of it. Nice bread with olive oil and tomato paste. Ceviche with plantain chips. Grilled pork belly. Artichoke and mozzarella soup. Meatballs. With a full belly I tour Museo del Oro before wandering markets in La Candelaria. I briefly leave the westerner area; it is neat and uncomfortable. I meet a nice American named Garrison at the bus depot. We eat some food and watch some game. We take a very long bus ride, eat some shitty convenience store food, and have a nice chat.	4.598678, -74.075207	Jun 23, 2014	Jun 29, 2014		Bogota, Medellin	1	4.598678, -74.075207	6.252206, -75.569169												https://photos.app.goo.gl/zdwFs643xmKbgKVM6
New York	One Year Married	52	x	We are here to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary. We take the train into Brooklyn, Todd & Sophie's band is playing a show in a loft space. They are good and we chat a while after they finish. We go to Momofuku Noodle Bar for ramen and another noodle dish. We walk to Pouring Ribbons. This place gorgeous, our bartender is friendly, and these cocktails are perfect. This is our first clarified milk punch, but it is already one of our favorite cocktails. We go see Todd & Sophie and hang on their rooftop a bit.<br><br>We head to Smorgisburg for ahi tartar nachos, a brisket sandwich, and a nice view of the city. Cruising Williamsburg, we pop by Catbird to swap a ring for Liz, by Blue Bottle for coffee, and to Goorin Bros for straw hats. We take the train and arrive at Coney Island just in time for the Mermaid Parade. There are lots of drag queens, boobs, and sequins. We pick up a good selection of roots and spices for making bitters at Kalustyan's. Then out for dinner at the big and noisy Beauty & Essex. It is good, but mostly memorable by how big and loud it is. At Amor y Amargo we drink strong stirred drinks and buy a fancy stirring glass. Todd & Sophie meet us and we walk a few doors down to Death & Co. Back to their place for more rooftop hanging with their wiener dog.<br><br>We eat a day-old chewy everything bagel on the train to JFK.	40.572770, -73.978939	Jun 20, 2014	Jun 22, 2014	Todd & Sophie		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/qVHJAgfppLv3nE6w6

Palm Springs	Parrot & Elk	50		Mom & Jim have the condo ready for us with B-day gifts and cold beer waiting inside. There is a towel dog on the bed. Honey, Jim's parrot, greets us with a whistle.<br><br>Mom makes eggs and cuts the mold off the cheese. To Palm Springs and a Mexican restaurant for margaritas & live music. Many people are dancing, all are white and over 50. A woman we met at Anthony's wedding runs a bar in town called Bar. We go in and greet her b/f, who is a disappointment. She is not present. We walk the strip and see pretty vintage cars and houses. Jim shows us two of Elvis' houses. We go on a tour of one of them. Mom takes us out to celebrate my birthday at Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. We drink a few Mai Tai's. A woman photo-bombs our b-day pic, then apologizes and buys me a drink. I photo-bomb someone else's b-day photo; I don't feel bad. To another bar where we meet Jim's son Justin.<br><br>Mother's Day brunch at the Elks Lodge. We drink Bloody Marys and meet Jake, Jim's other son, and his family.	33.830092, -116.539514	May 9, 2014	May 11, 2014	Mom & Jim		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/eUiKSJJK2VhVgYen8
Las Vegas	Viva	49	x	This hotel is cheap and the breakfast is awful. But we are not here for this hotel. We are here for Viva Las Vegas. We head to Rio, where it is being held. A fucking sweet, olive-green 60's suit catches my eye. I try it on and it fits as well as any suit I've ever tried on and I buy it. We do some more perusing and Liz finds a sweater and necklace. We go to a presentation in a theater. A nice looking man MCs a slideshow of gorgeous mid-century buildings that are now mostly demolished. We get drinks and a burrito. I put on my 'new' suit and we head to the Steady clothing co party. Stevie and Tara knows people here and got us tickets. After a bit we leave and then see some okay comedy. It's getting dark. We head to Planet Hollywood for very good stuff at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. The night wouldn't be complete with out a visit to our favorite dive tiki bar, Frankie's.<br><br>Breakfast is DuPar's (a classic American diner) for pancakes and an omelet. We head to the car show, which is massive. We just miss the swimsuit competition, but Liz and I both crush on an adorable woman lounging by the pool in a thong bikini and chiffon kimono. Nachos. We get front row tickets to the burlesque competition. We see about a dozen performers. Some are very good; others very amateur. Afterward, we meet & greet our favorite girls. Next is Burlesque Bingo. Liz wins the first round and dances on stage.	36.116486, -115.184424	Apr 19, 2014	Apr 20, 2014	Stevie, Tara		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/kzXK2pEqecSfFfca6
Austin	SXSW	48	x	We touch in the car before going to Anthony's house. With Anthony and Cheyenne we head to Beerland for Elvis Busts and a good all-female band. News circulates that a man just drove his car into a crowd outside Mohawk.<br><br>It's after noon when we get up. To Pitchfork Fest. Bands the bands are okay. We snack on good pork sandwiches then head to Whole Foods for nice juice with salt. I find a Xenakis album at Waterloo. 'Pi in the Sky' is written in the sky. Gian and a friend pick us up and drive us to a church for pretty good bands. Kimchi fried rice w/pork belly and egg on the street. We say hi to Jolene, Ryan, and Amy before heading back to Anthony's.<br><br>To Jim's for a diner breakfast with Ryan & Amy. I get the chicken fried steak. We catch up more while exploring a large antique mall. We meet Anthony at a Destruction Unit show, only to see them blow the power twice and give up. He takes us for an incredible cacio e pepe from a food truck. While we eat, there is groovy surf-rock band in luchador masks. Next show is in a pool hall. We hear JP5 (the Joey Plunkett 5, no relation), who instantly becomes our favorite band of the trip.<br><br>Houndstooth for a buzz and then an incredible beef rib and brisket from La Barbecue. JP5 is playing again at the Warehouse, so we go to see them. Red 7 for Speedy Ortiz. I win a Windows tablet. East Side Kings for miso ramen, Brussels sprout salad, and beet fries. Endless Bummer & Destruction Unit at Spider House. Liz guesses her b-day present (Rocky Horror Picture Show Soundtrack on vinyl) and is nearly in tears from a difficult round of 20 questions. Pumpkin home brew, meat leftovers, NBA Jam.<br><br>Houndstooth again.	30.295717, -97.741109	Mar 12, 2014	Mar 16, 2014	Anthony, Cheyenne, Gian		1														
Bisbee	History	47	x	I am waiting for Liz at the airport with flowers, chocolates, a book, and a poem. She gives me a handmade Valentine's Day card, a cocktail book, and a Rolling Stones shirt. South down the I-10 to the Titan Missile Museum. The metal inside is painted sea-foam green. A bobcat used to sleep on the silo cover. Continuing south, we hit Kartchner Caverns and do the Big Room. The lighting is tasteful. The floor is raised. The stone is pristine. This feels more sacred than any church I've ever visited. I am moved. We check into our Royal Mansion at the Shady Dell, a vintage Airstream trailer park. Cafe Roka for dinner and back to the Dell.<br><br>Breakfast in bed for Liz from Bisbee Breakfast Club. We head downtown to the antique mall. I find some vinyl (Sly - Fresh, Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms) and a washboard. On our way back we stop at the San Xavier Mission. I am disappointed that there is no fry bread. Lunch is Jax cafe for pistachio coated goat cheese balls and duck confit tacos.	31.435135, -109.885665	Feb 15, 2014	Feb 16, 2014		Tombstone, Kartchner Caverns, Bisbee	1														
Washington D.C.	Crashing	46		On the light rail an older woman tells me I shouldn't smoke pot in Texas. We visit the National mall and explore the Air and Space Museum for quite a few hours. Eric Idle's Galaxy Song is playing on a loop in one room. Mom is in town, so we meet her at a bar near the White House for a cocktail and snack.<br><br>The weight is heavy at the Lincoln Memorial.

Holbrook	Turquoise & Wigwam	44	x	Up the 87 highway to a snowy Payson. A roadside stand catches my eye, they are selling whipped honey. We don't object. A man outside La Posada explains that people used camels in the Sonoran Desert in the 19th century, hence the camel statues out front. We lunch in the Turquoise Room on a burger and a nice pork dish. The hotel doubles as an art gallery, which we take in for a good while. To Wigwam Village in Holbrook, where we have a reservation for the night. Though it is old and a run-down, there is a quaint charm to the place. We buy a wigwam Christmas ornament. We talk into the evening, snack, drink Bailey's, and read.<br><br>The Petrified Forest isn't far, so we head that way. There is a lot of petrified wood here. Geronimo, the largest piece of petrified wood in the region, looks like a redwood fell over and snapped into vertebrae. We touch in the car. Back to the Turquoise Room for another burger and soup, then back home.	34.902752, -110.168811	Dec 21, 2013	Dec 22, 2013		Winslow, Holbrook, Petrified Forest	1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/WfY922dFc67FUKaM9

At the floating flower market on the canal we pickup tulip bulbs for Catherine, Phoebe, and us. I get a green thing. Cheesy fondue at The Cheese Factory where we meet their restaurant cat named Simba. After a stroll through the red light district we snack on a crepe with cherries and whipped cream. At 2am, some guys are trying to rap to a smartphone speaker in our 12-bed hostel.<br><br>We begin the day with an unremarkable kebab and then have raclette on the street. This city is beautiful; we walk all over. Liz sees a coffee shop which looks nice, so we pop in and have a Bambino. The public library is supposedly beautiful so we head that way. It is. We spend a few hours in there reading and drawing. Dinner is fries w/curry ketchup and a Krakauer.<br><br>To a grocery store for chocolate and pesto before we fly home.	52.376023, 4.908465	Nov 24, 2013	Nov 30, 2013		Berlin, Quedlinburg, Hann Munden, Bonn, Cologne, Essen, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam	4	52.518803, 13.377035	51.790429, 11.144264	51.416816, 9.651646	50.736097, 7.104248	50.937132, 6.954581	51.225418, 6.774206	51.458157, 7.011434	52.376023, 4.908465						https://photos.app.goo.gl/iaYWGmeMNmKHveu78

While there we eat cooked mushrooms and a pretzel and drink gluhwein with rum. Our next stop is Essen for currywurst, a ladle for Krystle, and table runner for D&B. A brief visit to Dusseldorf for a Krakauer, liqueur for Fred, and candle spinner for J&D. We catch a train to Amsterdam where we check into another stinky hostel.	50.736097, 7.104248	Nov 24, 2013	Nov 30, 2013		Berlin, Quedlinburg, Hann Munden, Bonn, Cologne, Essen, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam	3	52.518803, 13.377035	51.790429, 11.144264	51.416816, 9.651646	50.736097, 7.104248	50.937132, 6.954581	51.225418, 6.774206	51.458157, 7.011434	52.376023, 4.908465						https://photos.app.goo.gl/iaYWGmeMNmKHveu78
Quedlinburg	Autobahn	41	x	We rent a Mercedes, Liz drives. Down the Autobahn. Some people drive very fast, but there is order. It feels safer than highways in the US. Coffee and a Berliner (jelly doughnut) from a gas station. To Quedlinburg first. It is a quaint Medieval town with a large castle. Lunch at Soljanka consists of a schnitzel, a brat, potatoes and cabbage. The countryside is majestic. Next stop is Hann Munden. It is night. The town features a large stone tower in the center. It is illuminated purple light. We eat some mediocre pizza then drive to Cologne, where we stay in a stinky hostel.	51.790429, 11.144264	Nov 24, 2013	Nov 30, 2013		Berlin, Quedlinburg, Hann Munden, Bonn, Cologne, Essen, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam	2	52.518803, 13.377035	51.790429, 11.144264	51.416816, 9.651646	50.736097, 7.104248	50.937132, 6.954581	51.225418, 6.774206	51.458157, 7.011434	52.376023, 4.908465						https://photos.app.goo.gl/iaYWGmeMNmKHveu78
Berlin	Autobahn	40	x	30 min into flight from Newark we turn around because the pilot says it smelled like 'dirty socks'. Apparently that can be a sign of something important leaking out of a place it shouldn't.<br><br>Berlin. Early morning. Two drunk young men are walking through the train station with golf clubs, looking for something to hit. Reichstag is full so we make a booking for tomorrow. Sandwiches and coffee. I learn about how Napoleon stole the Brandenburg Gate. To the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Out front are large ominous stone blocks we walk between. We attempt the flea market, though it is closing soon. Elton John the Robot is out front. After a currywurst and a waffle we relax in the hostel. Out late for a great kebab.<br><br>Through the Reichstag. There are little bits of the wall left in this part of town, but not much. To a Christmas Market nestled between two churches. The fries with quark and green onions are incredible, as is the Krakauer and cocoa. A witty vendor sells us some artisanal cream cheese and we get stone baked bread to accompany it.<br><br>Today we do the Pergamon Museum. We see the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, a reconstructed Roman marketplace entrance, and the Pergamon Altar. All three are massive and incredible to see inside a museum. Bread and cheese for dinner.	52.518803, 13.377035	Nov 24, 2013	Nov 30, 2013		Berlin, Quedlinburg, Hann Munden, Bonn, Cologne, Essen, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam	1	52.518803, 13.377035	51.790429, 11.144264	51.416816, 9.651646	50.736097, 7.104248	50.937132, 6.954581	51.225418, 6.774206	51.458157, 7.011434	52.376023, 4.908465						https://photos.app.goo.gl/iaYWGmeMNmKHveu78
Reno	Crashing	39		Mom is here for a postal convention and is letting us crash in her room at GSR. We drink Rumchata with her in the room. We go for all you can eat sushi in the hotel restaurant. It is surprisingly good. Noone gets sick. To the floor for some roulette. A man puts down $500 in one spin and loses.<br><br>Day trip to Mt. Rose, Lake Tahoe, and the Bloody Bucket.

Las Vegas	Sequins & Smoke	38	x	Mushroom burger with goat cheese and fries with curry ketchup at Burgr. Lost at roulette. To Jubilee, for the oldest show in Vegas. It is a bit dated, quite cheesy, and a great time. To Frankie’s Tiki Room. It smells like smoke. It is dim and dingy. Video poker machines dot the bar. Dusty nautical memorabilia hang from the ceiling. The drinks are cheap, strong, and delicious. We buy two souvenir mugs.	36.159463, -115.164626	Oct 19, 2013	Oct 20, 2013			1														
San Francisco	I Left My Phone in	37	x	We land an head to Phil's place where we relax for a while. In the evening, Liz and I head to a comedy show. Walking there, a man pushes me hard from behind. I fall to the ground. Am I getting mugged? He is immediately yelling at me. "Pu**y." "You think that's funny?" "F***ot." What the hell is happening? After a minute of this he storms off. Dumbfounded. A minute later he returns, continues yelling at me in the same manner, and then storms off for good. We are confused and shaken. A group of people across the street were watching the whole thing. We make eye contact with them. They shrug. It is difficult to enjoy the comedy show. The fact that the comedy is terrible isn't helping.<br><br>With Phil to Philz coffee for breakfast and a minty mojito latte. Next to Rooky Ricardo’s where I pick up some good 60's female soul mixes. We drink peanut milk shakes and walk to Haight Street. A girl named Kali introduces herself and offers to share a joint. Dazed in Whole Foods; I want to snack on everything. We wander through Golden Gate Park and come upon talented folks gliding on roller skates. One older man takes a break and sits down on a bench for a snack. Soon a squirrel comes up to him and jumps onto his knee. He is not surprised. He hands over a bit of food. The critter takes it and they eat together. To El Zocalo for cheesy, greasy, delicious Pupusas. Then to El Rio for well drinks and burlesque. I accidentally leave my phone on the BART on the way to meet Phil at Press Club, where we drink wine and smell many dried spices in a box — which are meant to help train one's wine note identification. Back at the station I talk to the station officer. We used Find My iPhone to track my device. We see that my phone is in Oakland, but moving quickly towards us. We realize that it is still on the train and is coming back our way. The train arrives at our station and the officer holds it briefly while we scour the seats. We don't find it and he has to let the train pull away. I am down. Liz is still calling and someone answers. A woman picked up my phone at that station when Liz had been calling it. She is already on a bus, but gets off to meet us. We thank her profusely and give her Oreos plus cab fare home.<br><br>To Philz again for delicious drinks. We ride the train to Ocean Beach to see the sand castle competition, but it is canceled due to the government shutdown. To Berkeley where we meet Melvin. A stroll through the beautiful campus together. We join Katelyn and David and all head for a curry.<br><br>Phil blares music while speeding us to the airport.	37.760260, -122.434266	Oct 10, 2013	Oct 13, 2013	Phil, Melvin, Katelyn & David		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ouHBHS4jnFLRNVX6
Santa Barbara	Coasting	36	x	We land in Santa Barbara and rent a car. First we drive to Solvang and coincidentally arrive during the Danish Days festival. We watch a sword demonstration, folk dancing, and Cuckoo clocks making. We snack on ebelskiver, a pancake ball with jam in it. Next to Pismo Beach for white clam chowder. We make it to San Luis Obispo in the evening and head to Goshi for sushi. We sit at the bar. Everything we eat is very good. The chef notices us close our eyes while we eat and says he's happy to see us focus on the food. He then gives us a free tuna tataki.<br><br>To Kreuzberg for coffee and a croissant donut. We pass by live zebras and listen to a pre-recorded tour, narrated by Alex Trebek, on the bus to Hearst Castle. We only see a few of the many rooms, but thoroughly enjoy it. We drive back down the coast and eat more chowder. I buy bongos from an antique store in Santa Barbara. A quick stop by the beach and then to the airport.	35.685208, -121.168236	Sep 21, 2013	Sep 22, 2013		Santa Barbara, Solvang, San Luis Obispo	1	34.417202, -119.712784	34.595566, -120.138274	35.140122, -120.642377	35.282921, -120.659582	35.685208, -121.168236									https://photos.app.goo.gl/QW2YiRcXvuion2Wf8
Dublin	Wedding Part Deux	35	x	We land, head into town, and sleep on a public bench for a few hours. We wake and head to the Temple Bar district. I buy a copy of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man from a local book shop. We head into a pub for carrot tarragon soup, sweet potato curry, salad, and elderflower squash. Liz and I make up songs about each other as we walk along the water. Mine goes "I'm a laaaydee, I'm a laaaydee, I put on my make-up in the morn-ing, ...I LIKE GIN". Her's goes: "I'm a man, I'm a man, I look real handsome, I shake my weiner at my lady." We check into the hostel and head to the pub downstairs for a dink. The bartender makes fun of me because I ask Liz for money.<br><br>We booked a tour for today and head south to Glendalough. We walk through a post-glacial valley with a lake, a cemetery, and a round house. We visit an old tomb with massive cap stone. Next to Kilkenny where we have a great burger, I buy a tin-whistle, and we lie on a green in front of the castle. Back in Dublin, we meet Alyse by the spire (a.k.a. the 'erection in the intersection', the 'spike on the dike', the 'stiletto in the ghetto', and the 'stiffy by the Liffey'). We find a nice pub with an American Bluegrass band playing and hang there a to chat.<br><br>Rashers & eggs for breakfast. We explore town some more. We are craving a scone. I settle for a not very good one, which I am okay with because I am hungry. I learn, however, that while I get angry when I don't eat food, Liz gets angry when she eats bad food. This is bad food. We take a guided tour of the Guinness Storehouse, which is interesting, though quite self-indulgent. Now evening, we head to the Palace Bar and meet Peter, who is in town on business. We have a drink and head to The Boxty, which only had two boxtys on the menu. Next to another bar for some Tullamore Dew and a nice chat.<br><br>We don't make the flight back to the US so we catch one to Barcelona instead. We sleep uncomfortably on the floor in the Barcelona airport.<br><br>We get first class to Philadelphia. I eat a great steak and watch The Sound of Music.<br><br>We have dinner and drinks in Dallas at Victor Tangos before catching a plane to Phoenix.	53.349956, -6.260265	Jul 27, 2013	Jul 30, 2013	Alyse, Peter	Philadelphia, Brussels, Gent, South Downs, Brighton, Dublin	6	39.953499, -75.159257	50.847431, 4.354064	51.057590, 3.721144	50.959164, -0.510883	50.815399, -0.137039	53.349956, -6.260265	53.004768, -6.334859	52.650654, -7.248773						https://photos.app.goo.gl/tm7kPKTEFhuD3GpdA
South Downs	Wedding Part Deux	34	x	After a stroll through Hyde park we head to the V&A Museum to attend a special David Bowie exhibition. Next to Soho where I buy a messenger bag from Ben Sherman. To Golden Union for the first time where we order fish & chips and a honeycomb milkshake. We catch a bus to 221b Baker Street to the the famous faux-home of Sherlock Holmes. We take a bus to Stansted to get a rental car. I practice driving for a few and then we're off to Granny’s. She serves cake and tea in the living room. We walk to Jade Fountain for yummy westernized Chinese food, including my first Peking Duck. Next we drive to a villa in the South Downs Anne and Richard rented for the wedding party. We relax with them and have a nice dinner at the house.<br><br>We all take a day trip to Brighton where we go watch shopping, push pennies, and snack on 99 flakes. Back to The Castle that for a curry dinner.<br><br>The Lemaire's arrive in the morning. We take a tour of a local winery then head into a nearby town for a French dinner, which the Nivens join for. Liz & I head into London for a 1930’s themed boat ride along the Thames. We miss the first half of the event and the live band, but still have a lovely time.<br><br>In the morning we write new vows. Many people arrive for the reception. Ruth & fam, Rachel & kids, Fran & fam, plus many others attend. Jake and Jamie play soccer. Justin lies on the grass. Richard says kind words. Liz & I read paraphrased vows. We proceeded to take photos, eat, drink, and be married. We drive back to Stansted. I fly Ryanair for the first time and hate it.	50.959164, -0.510883	Jul 22, 2013	Jul 27, 2013		Philadelphia, Brussels, Gent, South Downs, Brighton, Dublin	4	39.953499, -75.159257	50.847431, 4.354064	51.057590, 3.721144	50.959164, -0.510883	50.815399, -0.137039	53.349956, -6.260265	53.004768, -6.334859	52.650654, -7.248773						https://photos.app.goo.gl/tm7kPKTEFhuD3GpdA
Gent	Wedding Part Deux	33	x	We meet Didier and his other surfer, get beers, and head to the water to watch the fireworks. It is a solid show with music synced to the explosions, which I've never seen before. We drink more beers. We meet Didier’s brother. We eat more fries.<br><br>Up at 2pm and can't fall back asleep. Hours later we have waffles with whipped cream & strawberries and a cappuccino at Mokabon. We kayak up the river and see the castle plus some baby ducks. Down a ways more and we are able to listen to a concert from the water. Then to an Irish pub for cider, cheesy bacon fries, and pork cheek in stout sauce. We find out there is a festival happening now which I'm not sure how to describe. There are theatre, art, and music performances happening all around the city. We go to a place called Bata Bata. Men in safari outfits immediately sit Didier in the king’s chair and carry him above their heads while they snake through the grounds. There is a massive animatronic 'Farting Aunt'. They do a 'ten-second techno', which is what it sounds like. A man proposes to a woman. It turns into a foam party. We head back to Didier's and watch YouTube videos.<br><br>We take our time getting up and then catch a bus for London.	51.057590, 3.721144	Jul 20, 2013	Jul 22, 2013		Philadelphia, Brussels, Gent, South Downs, Brighton, Dublin	3	39.953499, -75.159257	50.847431, 4.354064	51.057590, 3.721144	50.959164, -0.510883	50.815399, -0.137039	53.349956, -6.260265	53.004768, -6.334859	52.650654, -7.248773						https://photos.app.goo.gl/tm7kPKTEFhuD3GpdA
Brussels	Wedding Part Deux	32	x	We head into the city and have a chicken curry sandwich for lunch from the type of cafe you find in financial districts. We walk down a main drag where people seem to be out celebrating. There are many tanks parked on the street. We learn a new king will be anointed today. We tour the Musical Instrument Museum - which doesn't hold a candle to the one in AZ. Next we snack on curry ketchup fries  on the street and watch police show off their K9 units. We get a nice latte from a 3rd wave type shop. We go see the Peeing Boy, who is dressed up like a soldier...with his penis out though.	50.847431, 4.354064	Jul 20, 2013	Jul 20, 2013		Philadelphia, Brussels, Gent, South Downs, Brighton, Dublin	2	39.953499, -75.159257	50.847431, 4.354064	51.057590, 3.721144	50.959164, -0.510883	50.815399, -0.137039	53.349956, -6.260265	53.004768, -6.334859	52.650654, -7.248773						https://photos.app.goo.gl/tm7kPKTEFhuD3GpdA
Philadelphia	Wedding Part Deux	31		We come upon two men who were arguing on the sidewalk. One begins to walk away, the other runs up behind him and boots him in the butt. A woman walking towards us has lipstick all around her mouth and on her teeth. We head into the massive indoor market and to an Amish diner for french toast with apple & cinnamon and eggs with scrapple, which is like sausage, spam, hash browns, and an omelet all at once. One serving is enough, ever. We find a chocolate shop that sells human body parts and then camp out at a coffee shop.	39.953499, -75.159257	Jul 19, 2013	Jul 19, 2013		Philadelphia, Brussels, Gent, South Downs, Brighton, Dublin	1	39.953499, -75.159257	50.847431, 4.354064	51.057590, 3.721144	50.959164, -0.510883	50.815399, -0.137039	53.349956, -6.260265	53.004768, -6.334859	52.650654, -7.248773						https://photos.app.goo.gl/tm7kPKTEFhuD3GpdA
San Francisco	Stuck in	30	x	We run into Brett at the departing gate. He is also doing a day trip to SF. He has rented a car and offers to take us to the Mission. We all go for breakfast for blue corn waffles and coffee. We part ways and Liz and I head to Paxton Gate to look at dead animals and corpse plants. A realtor calls me asking about my mom's house on the market. I text her, she informs me she and Fred are separating and that she is going to live at the cabin. We then find out a plane had crashed at SFO shortly after we landed and that the runway was closed. This throws a wrench into our plans of flying standby back to Phoenix that night. To Fisherman's Wharf where we meet up with Krystle and Devyn. We have some mediocre food plus beer. We explore Musée Mécanique where we play vintage arcade games and take a photo booth strip together. We are picked up by Brett and head to SFO, which has reopened, but is a mess for anyone flying standby due to all the canceled flights. Every airport within a 200 mile radius is full for all travel. We almost make it on a United flight with Brett, but there is a system glitch and they say they can't let us on even though there are open seats. Liz has a pinup photo shoot scheduled tomorrow in Phoenix so we decide to rent a car and drive all night to get back by the next morning.	37.623184, -122.384319	Jul 6, 2013	Jul 7, 2013	Bret, Krystle, Devyn		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ouHBHS4jnFLRNVX6
Tahiti	Honeymoon	29	x	We head into Pape'ete, but the town is pretty shut down as it is a Sunday morning. Back to the airport to rent a car. The automatics are about 3x more than the manuals, so we get a manual. Up until this point, I have basically never driven one though. I practice trying not to stall in the parking lot for quite a while and then start driving around the island. With the exception of a rough start, a few stalls, and not figuring out how to put it in reverse, I think it's going okay. We drive up and down the cost and tour the island. We stay in a hostel, but it is quiet and we get a private room. The other residents are mostly professional-aspiring surfers. We meet a lovely man from South Africa named Reese, who has been living here for three months in preparation to surf what he calls his Mecca. We have a burger in a Las Vegas themed restaurant then drive to the end of Tahiti Iti. Back to the hostel where we make coconut tuna with carrots and share with the other guests.<br><br>On our way back up we stop by a water logged cave and a very old temple complex, which feels rather Mayan. Liz and I lie on the grass and watch the birds flying overhead. They have long tails which gave them a beautiful silhouette. As we are nearly back to the airport to return the car, it starts making funny sounds and smoking from the hood — later I will learn that I was not meant to be using the clutch to regulate my speed while driving. We let cool down for a few and make it back. I neglect to mention the smoke. We take a bus into town where we find a cheap hostel and wander downtown. We visit a market, a church, some pearl shops, and a cafe where we eat more raw tuna. We have a beer and coffee at a cafe. Soon we find a food truck lot and order tuna fondue, which is yummy. We also order a chow mein for breakfast.<br><br>We eat the chow mein, get on a plane home, and watch Wreck it Ralph.	-17.761632, -149.364599	Jun 29, 2013	Jul 2, 2013		Bora Bora, Papeete	2	-16.476855, -151.771515	-17.761632, -149.364599												https://photos.app.goo.gl/oWMptPNkzxgYPmGV7
Bora Bora	Honeymoon	28	x	We fly standby to Tahiti and then take a prop plane to Bora Bora. Liz books our resort hotel only when we get seats on the flight. A boat takes us to the resort where we stay in an over-water bungalow. We swim a bit and relax in the bay. We touch a good bit. In the afternoon we play mini golf and go snorkeling. We take a boat to the main island for dinner at Maikai Marina: ribeye w/blue cheese sauce and tuna carpaccio.<br><br>There is an incredible breakfast buffet. We have eggs benedict, banana juice, guava jelly, and french toast. We spend today playing pool and tennis, snorkeling, eating ice cream, and having cocktails. We take a boat to the island again for dinner at St. James: raw tuna platter, steak with black truffle mash.<br><br>Great breakfast buffet again and more snorkeling. We check out and head to the main island and into a quaint B&B. We head into the town Vaitape and watch some of the Heiva celebrations. The dancing and music are incredible and unlike anything I have ever heard. There are about twenty instruments similar to ukuleles strumming very quickly. Some men percuss hollow logs. Women sing quickly and in rich harmonies. We find a seafood tent further down the beach an order a massive raw tuna plate and a shrimp curry. I am hot and I decide to cut my jeans into shorts in the toilet with a steak knife. We walk through a casino inside another tent where some children are playing roulette. An nice older man sees our interest and gives Liz a few chips, which we quickly lose. <br><br>We have a boat excursion planned for today. The first spot is a reef where we snorkel and see many colorful fish. Next is the black fin shark feeding area where we are surrounded by about 20 sharks. We stop at a deserted island for a lunch of BBQ fish, coconut ceviche, taro, tapioca, coconut bread, banana bread pudding, watermelon and grapefruit. We fill up. Next is a long ride to a sandbar with stingray. The guides show us how to grab the rays' nose and ride them. I try. After a few unsuccessful attempts, I get a hold of one and one who quickly rams my head into the side of the boat. For dinner we make a pizza and escargot.	-16.476855, -151.771515	Jun 25, 2013	Jun 29, 2013		Bora Bora, Papeete	1	-16.476855, -151.771515	-17.761632, -149.364599												https://photos.app.goo.gl/oWMptPNkzxgYPmGV7
Montezuma	Zipping Around	26	x	From La Fortuna we take a bus to San Ramon and eat a nice breakfast of beans and eggs. This town has a worn-down Mediterranean quality to it. We walk around for a bit and take in the pretty church. Next to Puntarenas for cold beers and meat sticks on the street. We ride a ferry and a bus to Montezuma. We quickly find a cute beachfront hostel for $10/night. The owner is a lovey man who offers some of the seafood chowder he is making. We head to a pizza restaurant for dinner. Liz thinks she sees a cockroach scuttling across the floor. It is, in fact, a baby crab.<br><br>We have a boat excursion planned for today. As we are waiting on the street for our tour group to meet up, a drunk man is walking aimlessly with four cute dogs happily following his every step. First we go to Isla Tortuga where we snorkel around a big rock. The water isn't clear, but we see some interesting looking fish. Next to another small island for more snorkeling. I find an octopus curled up on a rock. I accidentally frighten it and it squirts ink at me. I decide to swim around the island. This is a stupid idea. It is quite wavy and rocky and takes about 20 minutes. When I come back around everyone is already back in the boat and waiting for me. Back to Isla Tortuga where we have pineapple, watermelon, beer, fish stew, and potatoes. We hang there a while and meet some local wildlife including a large iguana, two vultures, two little pigs, a few parrots, many crabs, and a sweet cuddly boar named Jo. A marimba band is playing Beer Barrel Polka for some folks at a nearby resort. I play some volleyball with a Quebecois couple and then we all swim in the warm water. On the ride back it rains painfully right on us. We go to a nice restaurant in town for creamy avocado pasta, nachos, and a coconut milkshake.<br><br>We hike to see a waterfall, but the river is too high so we can't get to it. We then catch a bus to take us to Liberia. Our driver leaves the door open (presumably for airflow) as he flies down the mountain at a breakneck speed to apparently make sure we catch the ferry on time. We do. Hours later we are in town. We get a bit lost looking for our hotel. It is dark, but we hear a beautiful chorus of frogs. We check into our hotel and head next door for BBQ meat. They are having a live magic show. I am surprised I am able to generally follow what is happening, but I guess magic is pretty universally understood. <br><br>One more empanada and a bus to the airport. We miss our stop because we didn't tell the driver to stop and have to catch a cab the rest of the way back.	9.653961, -85.068203	May 25, 2013	Jun 1, 2013		San Jose, Monteverde, La Fortuna, San Ramon, Puntarenas, Montezuma, Isla Tortuga, Liberia	5	9.924447, -84.088971	10.273355, -84.823296	10.467577, -84.642277	10.091191, -84.471537	9.653961, -85.068203	10.634486, -85.440230								https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rag2Ja4pprEcUP4XA

We spend a few hours walking around the city, which smells of delicious food, urine, and car exhaust. There is a John Lennon statue sitting on a park bench. Liz feels an earthquake in the middle of the night.<br><br>We head to bus station and have greasy empanadas there. We take a few hour bus ride to Monteverde. The mountains are large, lush, misty, and dreamlike. We wind our way through them, passing many quaint farming towns along the way. We arrive in the Monteverde and are staying at Cabinas el Pueblo, a cute B&B run by a local family. We go to Taco Taco for tacos and then head over to do a zip-line canopy tour. We hike up a mountain for about 30 min and then begin. They are chained together and we do about fifteen lines in all. There is also a 25" swing we each get to go on. The last line is a 1km tandem that Liz and I ride together. Upon our return we order a malty, crunchy Nutella shake. We buy some toys for the kids. Back to the hostel where we touch nice. We eat dinner in a tree house.<br><br>Pancakes for breakfast then we take a jeep-boat-jeep with stunning green mountains and more majestic farming towns. We arrive in La Fortuna without a plan. Within a minute of getting off the bus and walking down the street, an older white American expat named Thomas and his lady friend greet us and being asking us questions. They seem nice and helpful, at first. They recommend a good hotel, which we book. We then find out that the hotel doesn't have A/C or lockers. We are beginning to get a bit suspicious. They then recommend a lunch spot. We are hungry and don't know anything in town, so we say okay. While we aren't quite foolish enough to fall for the Chinese tea trick (we make sure the menu had prices listed). He begins asking lots of detailed questions about our plans and recommends a booking agency for tours. We are fully aware at this point that, even in a best case scenario, he is getting kickbacks from those companies. We tell him we're not sure what we want to do and he seems annoyed. We tell him we're leaving and he says he'll check back in on us after lunch. We go the hostel and cancel our reservation. Surprisingly, they give us a full refund. We find another very cute hotel with a pool and have some tiki drinks at the bar. We check out some of the tour packages, but everything seems a bit pricey and contrived; we are not feeling this town. We opt to just hang by the pool and watch more Arrested Development. 	10.273355, -84.823296	May 25, 2013	Jun 1, 2013		San Jose, Monteverde, La Fortuna, San Ramon, Puntarenas, Montezuma, Isla Tortuga, Liberia	2	9.924447, -84.088971	10.273355, -84.823296	10.467577, -84.642277	10.091191, -84.471537	9.653961, -85.068203	10.634486, -85.440230								https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rag2Ja4pprEcUP4XA
Las Vegas	The Rolling Stones	21	x	We stop by Palazzo for some mediocre food. Shortly after, we pick up incredible pastries from Bouchon Bakery. We quickly blow $40 on roulette. It is dinner time and we head to the Bellagio Buffet for nigiri, maki, oysters rockefeller, lobster mac, prime rib, quail, lamb rack, boar leg, shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon, mussels, king crab, bananas foster, and a very full belly. From there we walk to MGM and watch the Rolling Stones play. They look like skeletons and sound great. Mick's dance moves are on fire. Liz finds him quite sexy. After the show I run 1.5 miles (with Street Fighting Man in my head) to get the car for Liz.	36.102715, -115.171469	May 11, 2013	May 11, 2013			1														
Las Vegas	Angie's Wedding	20	x	We drive up and meet Dad, Barb & some sibs at the Grand Hilton, where many of us will be staying. We head to the Garden Bar at the Flamingo to meet the rest of the family and have some drinks.<br><br>For breakfast we meet Justin, Danielle, Nikki, Krys, and Devyn at the jacuzzi and have drinks. There are too many people for one cab so we we say what the hell and get a limo. The ceremony is touching and quaint. Liz and I stop by Gordon Ramsay's pub for a snack & drink before heading to dinner proper at Batista's. The food is not very good, but we drink loads of wine and get Devyn drunk for maybe the first time. Liz, Justin, Danielle, Krys, Devyn, Gian and I wander the casino. Justin sees a motorcycle as a prize above a slot machine and loudly proclaims 'Hey, look at that motorcycle, FUCK YOU!'. Liz and I have tickets for Cirque du Soleil's Love at Mandalay Bay, so we head for that. The music and performance are both incredible and dreamlike. Gian informs us that he put our name on a list for the Cee-lo Green concert so, after Love finishes, we literally run over to Planet Hollywood to see him perform. It is a hoot and very hokey. Boy George comes out and does a lip-sync to a medley of his hits. A woman makes a balloon penis and put it all the way down her throat.<br><br>Up for breakfast at the Park restaurant on Fremont. We leave town and stop by the Hoover Dam on our way back to Phoenix.	36.115679, -115.167901	Apr 13, 2013	Apr 15, 2013			1														
San Diego	The Specials	19	x	Standby flight. We arrive mid-afternoon. We catch a train to downtown. We pass a restaurant called Current, which looks fun. We pop in for three-cheese rosemary popcorn and a couple of cocktails. I am in the market for a wedding band. We stop by a pawn shop and buy one. There is a Goorin Bros hat shop. I buy a pork-pie hat. We walk just down the street to the venue. The lights go out, police sirens sound, organ chords ascend, and we get an amazing performance of Ghost Town. It is my first time seeing Terry Hall. He doesn't smile once and only from time to time would give any indication (such as a curtsy) that he was enjoying himself whatsoever. They play some very good music and it is a blast. We meet Andy after the show and he offers us a ride back to the airport. We sleep, rather unsuccessfully, under a bench for a while until our morning flight.	32.715713, -117.160848	Mar 19, 2013	Mar 19, 2013			1														
Kaua'i	Alarming	18	x	We fly standby and have no plans. We decide to rent a car at the airport. In Lihue, we go to a diner where we eat saimin noodle soup and passion fruit chiffon pie. We decide to drive south and west. It is already getting late. We buy wine and snacks then head to the beach to sleep for the night. It is dark. The waves are loud and ominous. We drink wind on the sand and fool around. Back to the car to sleep. In the middle of the night I open the car door and set of the alarm. It takes me a few minutes to find the keys and turn it off.<br><br>To Waimea Canyon for a view of the mountains. Back at the coase, we visit an historic Russian fort. We drive east and decide to visit a coffee plantation. I take pictures of lizards. Someone asks if I am in a (famous) band. Back in Lihue we eat BBQ ribs then continue north. We stop at a two different waterfalls and take some photos. A man is hitchhiking. We pick him an American man who has his thumb out. He is only going to the next town so we drop him off after a few. Next we visit a lighthouse and watch birds surfing the cliff winds. Onto a beach where we play Frisbee; a dog joins in. Our next stop is a gaping cave on the side of the road. We reach the literal end of the road. There is a beach here. We sit and watch the sun set. We get pizza and tiki drinks, picked up another hitchhiker, and head back to Lihue to catch a flight.	21.972167, -159.733183	Mar 1, 2013	Mar 2, 2013			1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rpdkij1z5ZodWp6w7
New York	New Year	17	x	On the flight, a mother with a baby is angry about having to change seats after the crew explained that in an emergency there wouldn't be an oxygen mask for the baby. We land in JFK and take the train in. It is already very cold. I buy a beanie and gloves. To downtown. We stop by a Starbucks to get caffiene and use the toilet. There is a long line for the bathroom. People seem tense. We walk to 7th ave. Times Square is on 45th st, but the closest we can get is 57th st. We are in a large pen very tightly packed with people. I can see a few neon lights in the distance, 12 blocks away. Someone points out which of those lights is "The Ball". We mostly stand around for the next three and a half hours. It is very dark, so much so that we are able to take turns touching each other without anyone seeming to notice. At around 11, we chat with two parents and a teenage boy. They are from Colombia and are here to see the ball. The inform us that they've brought dried lentils, which are a good luck charm for the new year, and shared them with us. We put a handful in our pockets. When the clock strikes 12, we toss the lentils up in the air. The next two minutes are pure jubilant. The the crowd quickly dissipates. By 12:10 we are able to walk around a deserted Times Square. We wander the adjacent streets. A horn band is playing Auld Lang Syne. We find an Irish pub and pop in for a drink. We are tired and don't have a hotel so we hop on a train back to the airport. In the train car, a woman looking very unwell vomits into her plush white gloved hands. We sleep on the airport floor for a few hours. We get on the first flight of the morning. I get 1st class, but Liz has to fly coach because she was wearing converse.	40.758952, -73.985066	Dec 31, 2012	Jan 1, 2013			1														
Austin	Meat and Whiskey	16	x	We fly in and Anthony picks us up. He needs to stop by his to touch his mice. He shows us a room with about 10 caged chimps with diodes in their heads. At one point they see my teeth, take it as a sign of aggression, and begin shouting. Time to go. Down to congress where we eat a slice of greasy pizza and wander a few antique shops. He takes us to La Barbeque where we proceed to order way too much meat. This beef rib is the best piece of barbecue I've ever eaten; the outside is caramelized black and fat is liquid. We get a ride over to Ryan & Amy's house. We listen to old country and pet Joelene. Next we head to a whisky bar, where we meet back with Anthony and I try Buffalo Trace.<br><br>Anthony drives us out to the Hill Country where we take a leisurely drive. We stop at a vineyard to walk around and take pictures. The owner doesn't seem very pleased about our being there and asks us to leave.	30.249522, -97.749493	Dec 1, 2012	Dec 2, 2012	Anthony, Amy & Ryan Booth		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/xGb2GEbgmsC18jT17
Las Vegas	Proposing	15		I will propose to Liz today. We get off the bus from the airport and walk down the strip for a bit. I have to keep getting down on one knee, because my socks are slipping down. She doesn't think anything of it. I don't yet know when or where I will do it, just that I will. We enter the Bellagio and head towards the infamous buffet for dinner. Walking down the hall we see a crepe stand, which looks yummy, and change our plans for that instead. We wander the lobby. There is a hot-air balloon exhibit. I consider proposing here. There is a brief moment, but it is imperfect. It is gone. It needs to feel right. We walk out of the front entrance. The sun has just set. The fountains are beginning their dance. Your Song, by Elton John, comes on the speakers. It is corporate, tacky, and beautiful; a perfect Las Vegas moment. My sock slips. I ask Liz to hold my coat and bend I down. I ask her to get my phone out of my jacket pocket. She pats it and says it's not in there. "It definitely is". She reaches inside this time and finds a piece of paper. She pulls it out. It is a photo booth strip. 1. "Will". 2. "You". 3. "Marry me?". 4. Me holding a pearl necklace. She reads it and looks down at me. I am holding the necklace. "Will you marry me?". She comes down to my level, wraps her arms around me, and started kissing me. A few moments later she stops, looked me in the eyes, and says 'YES!'. A bit more hugging and kissing, then we hurry because we have tickets for Penn & Teller. On the way she calls her parents—who already knew—and texts a few friends. She calls Rachel. "Michael Plunkett engaged to me...I mean we're proposed...WE'RE ENGAGED!". The show is fantastic. Midway through the show, they call on Liz, give her a book of jokes and ask her to read one. They show that they already knew which joke she would pick from the book. No clue how. After the show, Liz finds Puppy's mouse in her purse. We stay up a few more hours, then catch a plane home.	36.111643, -115.174338	Nov 23, 2012	Nov 23, 2012			1														
Las Vegas	Deep	14	x	We land and catch a ride to Boulder City Airport. Liz booked us a helicopter tour of the Western edge of the Grand Canyon. We hop in the chopper and whirl away. Our pilot points out the cliff Thelma and Louise drove off of. The canyon is massive and majestic. We are flying through the middle of it. It is absolutely stunning and all happens very fast. We land at the bottom. The pilot sets up a plastic table and lays out snacks with champagne. After about 10 minutes they fly us back and it's all over. Back in a car to the Riviera. It is old and pretty dingy. Not at all charming the way Imperial Palace is. We relax have some nice times in the room. It is evening now. We go downstairs, eat Indian food from the food court and give away some money very quickly. Included with our hotel stay is a ticket to a mediocre comedy show, which was not advertised as such.	35.978289, -114.835268	Oct 11, 2012	Oct 12, 2012		Las Vegas, Grand Canyon	1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/7yZAnAE5uhxsbKgv7
Seattle	Poutine & White Russians	13	x	From Vancouver we take a bus into Seattle. We are tourists so we head to Pike's Place where we watch men throw fish and drink a terrible cup of coffee. We pick up a bottle of wine for our soon-to-be Couchsurfing host. We head to a better looking cafe and drink better tasting coffee. We take a bus south to our host's nice big house. The key is hidden in a potted plant. Larry is home and shows us around. We give him the bottle wine and we all immediately drink it. Then he make us all White Russians...to go. We get in his convertible mini cooper and drive downtown. Back to Pike St where we look at a wall covered in gum and then to a bar for snacks and chats. Afterward Larry takes us to another local CS host's house. We hang out with some other surfers, listen to late Smashing Pumpkins, eat fish & chips, and play some guitar. We say goodby to Larry & folks and head to Montana Bar for a coffee cocktail. We meet a dog and Liz's friends. Back to the airport and to bed.	47.608457,-122.340203	Oct 3, 2012	Oct 5, 2012		Vancouver, Seattle	2	47.608457,-122.340203	49.281487, -123.095104												https://photos.app.goo.gl/VEutbY15mQ2xgZSHA
Vancouver	Poutine & White Russians	12	x	Our first mission is to eat some poutine. We do. We cross the bridge to Granville Market where we look through kaleidoscopes then eat olives and purple peppers on the steps out front. A man is playing a chapman stick. We catch a bus to our hotel. It drops us off about a block from the hotel, which happens to be Vancouver's equivalent of Skid Row. We are surrounded by homeless people. It is a very strange sensation. No one interacts with us. We are in a bit of a state of shock. We say nothing aloud, but we have each decided we will cancel the hotel. When we cross the last block to the hotel we find the mood suddenly changed. It is as though the large homeless community consciously decided that their area ended at that corner. The concierge reassures us that the neighbors are not a problem. We decide keep our booking and thoroughly enjoy the hotel. After relaxing a bit we walk downtown and admire a very talented roller skater/dancer.<br><br>We get up and head to Stanley Park where we rent a tandem bike. It is a bit tricky to ride at first, but we find our balance before long. After returning the bike we find some cheap sushi, which is not very good. More poutine, this time in the gay district. It is cold out so we go to the movie theater and watch Looper. We are feeling cheeky—and cold—so after Looper we sneak into see The Master. We head to Greyhound terminal early (though late at night), but it is closed. We try to sleep on the street, but it is too cold so we enter a nearby McDonalds. They let us hang out there, but they don't allow sleeping so we force ourselves to stay awake, next to a few other bus waiters.	49.281487, -123.095104	Oct 1, 2012	Oct 3, 2012		Vancouver, Seattle	1	47.608457,-122.340203	49.281487, -123.095104												https://photos.app.goo.gl/VEutbY15mQ2xgZSHA
Portland	Hamlet	11	x	Megan picks us up and takes us to her home, where we meet Ollie (her bf) and Nacho (her cat). Ollie shows us the photobooth he is building. Megan and I look at a book of gorilla portraits. Megan shows me lyrics to a song I wrote her years ago. I cringe at the amateur quality of the writing.<br><br>To Voodoo for donuts and then to Powell's for Point Omega and a 12-volume set of Lewis and Clark's journals for Richard. I find out Alex Novie is just down the street, so we meet up for a quick hello. Next we head to Stumptown and then onto Burnside Skatepark to watch some talented folks dance on plywood. Up to Hawthorne for poutine and then we met Paige at her place. She and her roommates serve us Negronis and lasagna. We talk into the night.<br><br>We walk and quickly find a shop with a delicious smoky orange latte. To Pine State Biscuits where we eat sausage & biscuits and fried green tomatoes. Next to Paxton Gate—a irreverent taxidermy shop. My highlight is a mouse dressed as Hamlet holding a mouse skull.	45.554211, -122.675345	Sep 29, 2012	Oct 1, 2012	Megan Irwin, Alix Novie, Paige & roommates		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/aB7EEQzibLqTuKog6
Orlando	Crashing	10	x	Mom invited us to stay with her during her postal convention; we of course accept. At a Disney World seafood restaurant I try Scotch for the first time (Johnny Walker Black)—it burns. <br><br>We spend most of the day doing Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios with Mom. It is lovely. We meet Helen that night and walk along the beach. <br><br>In the morning we draw an airplane on a piece of paper and use it to hitchhike to the airport.	28.385605, -81.563871	Jul 28, 2012	Jul 29, 2012	Mom, Helen		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/M2fqaH9t1fjQPNAL7
London	Vinyl & Bronze	9	x	We stop by Fran's house to meet the family and drop off our stuff. It's still early so we check out the Tate Modern. Back to Fran's for a curry dinner.<br><br>We take a train to Swanley and meet Elaine. She drives us to Ightham Mote where we explore the old house and crypt. I see my first Welsh writing. David comes home. He drives us, very quickly, to an Indian restaurant with the best Chicken Tikka Masala I've ever had. Back at the house they give us their vinyl record collection.<br><br>To Grannie's for tea, biscuits, and a drizzly afternoon. We eat crispy duck followed by strawberries and cream.<br><br>Breakfast is rashers and instant coffee. We take the train into the city and visit Soho. Liz finds a lovely dress in Kingley Court. I buy a leather bag from Ben Sherman. That evening we attend a 1940's themed party. There is a live swing band and all are in very appropriate panoply. We dance, imbibe, and dare I say swing. We nearly aren't let on our night bus due to tardiness, but Liz argues our way on board. To the Manchester airport for bad coffee and 2 kilos of CDM before our flight home.	51.512678, -0.138055	Jul 14, 2012	Jul 18, 2012	Fran & fam, David & Elaine, Helen, Barbara, Peter,	Philadelphia, Paris, London	3	39.934019, -75.158850	48.851846, 2.318435	51.512678, -0.138057											https://photos.app.goo.gl/jxbhVUsGQahgk2BA7
Paris	Vinyl & Bronze	8	x	After a Croque Madame near the station we spend a good chunk of the day looking for a hotel. Apparently EVERYTHING in Paris (under $400) is booked for tonight. We eventually call Liz's dad to ask if he could check in with his friend Philippe, who lives in the city. He does and they offer to host us. We go to their place that night and have a lovely chat with the Lemaire family. We drink wine and eat at least four different cheeses.<br><br>The next morning we visit the market with Claire and have a nice lunch at the house consisting of saucisson, tomates et fromage. We head into the city, to Montmartre and Sacre Coeur, for a walkabout. We buy tickets to enter Lapin Agile, a cabaret, which we learn is not the same as a burlesque. This is a room of locals sitting around a piano singing essentially French drinking songs. We are given some very sweet wine and have a wonderful time singing Champs Elysée.<br><br>Out again. THe Rodin garden, Cotume, and Pere laChaise...were all closed. Instead we get wine, cheese, and bread from a market and picnic under the Eiffel Tower. That evening I attend a Brian Eno & Mond Kopf concert with Philippe. The music is excellent and Phillipe is a wonderful conversationalist. <br><br>To the Rodin statue garden for some excellent statues. To Cotume for delicious coffee. To Pont Neuf and Musee D'Orsay. We sit on steps outside the museum and eat ice cream. There is a wild-looking, hairy, potentially-vagrant man doing some of the best street comedy I have ever seen. He will walk behind a very posh woman an mimic her gate. She is unaware, but the audience on the steps eats it up. He runs up to a man on his phone and screams. We walk down Champs Elysée and have a juicy burger. We pass the Arc de Triomphe and take a night bus to London.	48.851846, 2.318433	Jul 12, 2012	Jul 14, 2012		Philadelphia, Paris, London	2	39.934019, -75.158848	48.851846, 2.318433	51.512678, -0.138055											https://photos.app.goo.gl/jxbhVUsGQahgk2BA7
Philadelphia	Vinyl & Bronze	7	x	We have a long layover before our flight to Paris, so we head into the city to explore a bit. We head to the 'Original Cheesesteak' from Geno's. It is very greasy and the bread is cheap. After some walking we stop for a nice root beer float. Shortly after that we find a bar that Mac, from IASIP, opened. We go in for a drink. It is nothing like Paddy's Pub and I am let down.	39.934019, -75.158848	Jul 12, 2012	Jul 14, 2012		Philadelphia, Paris, London	1	39.934019, -75.158849	48.851846, 2.318434	51.512678, -0.138056											https://photos.app.goo.gl/jxbhVUsGQahgk2BA7
Sacramento	Turks & Tahoe	6	x	First I eat a Thai tea sweet potato popsicle in a vintage 2nd hand store's garden. Next I walk around the city hall for a bit until Barb picks me up. To their place for a few and out to a Turkish restaurant where I had a lovely grilled whole fish. <br><br> Dad offers to let me borrow his truck for the day while he works. I accept. I drive to Lake Tahoe. Walking around, I see a brown bear and her two cubs on the side of a hill, about a hundred meters away. I watch them for a while until they disappear into the woods. I rent a kayak and paddle around Emerald Bay and to Fannette Island, where I climb to the top (it's not very high) and read a bit of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I drive around the lake. At one point I stop and decide to swim in the water. I jump in the lake, which is so cold that I become paralyzed for a few seconds. I shiver to shore and get back out. Liz arrives that evening. I have a nice guitar jam with Dad. <br><br>Up to Napa where we visit the Chandon winery and snack on some lovely charcuterie. To a casino where Barb and Dad treat us to a lovely steak dinner. Afterward we walk around the casino. A security guard comes up to me, asks me for an ID, and kicks me out for not having one. <br><br>The flights back look bad so we drink a few bottles of wine, get frisky in the airport bathroom, then take a bus to San Francisco, where we catch a flight back to Phoenix.	38.752697, -121.286733	Jun 25, 2012	Jun 28, 2012	D&B		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/vNLLrcmR2t5buJwo9
Worcester	A Trip in	5	x	Kelly picks us up from the airport and we drive to Worcester. She plays "ICe Cream Paint Job" and some Neutral Milk Hotel. At the house we meet Chris and Scout, her rabbit. I am quite sick. We explore an old church and a lovely outdoor area. They tell us about her uncle "Anne Frank" who's on the run from the authorities and lives in her parent's basement. Next we meet Lucy. We listen to Where the Buffalo Roam and a lot of Neutral Milk Hotel with the occasional Ice Cream Paint Job thrown in. I paint an ant's leg with nail polish to keep better track of it.	42.261694, -71.802590	Jun 8, 2012	Jun 10, 2012	Kelly $man	Worcester, Boston	1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/Th4ak1hMZQr6Np2e8
New York	Rock and a Hard Place	4	x	We meet David and Elaine at the Hard Rock in Times Square. They treat us to burgers and we get to know each other. They are absolutely lovey. David offers to give us his entire record collection when we visit them in the UK. Next to Brooklyn where we stay on Todd & Sophie's couch. Todd makes us quesadillas. <br><br>We explore the Lower East Side and get $.99 slices of incredible, greasy, smoky, cheese pizza. Later we watch Moonrise Kingdom with Todd and Sophie, who sneak a bottle of wine into the theater. Later that night Liz and I get locked out of the apartment. I am tempted to climb the fire escape, then I think better of it.	40.715094, -73.964751	May 25, 2012	May 28, 2012	David & Elaine, Todd & Sophie		1														https://photos.app.goo.gl/Fi7XJjBUDp28MUiw6
Las Vegas	Strip Strip Hooray!	3	x	This is first time on Fremont Street. I wish I would have gone as a kid so I could see how much it has changed since even the 90's. First we head to Hash House A-Go-Go for a griddled mozzarella fried chicken plate. We want to gamble, but our tastes are too cheap for even the Imperial Palace (whose charm we adore). To the House of Blues for Strip Strip Hooray: Murray Hill is the MC and he is perfect. His catchphrase is 'SHOWBIZ' (with jazz-hands) and he makes sure to beat it into us.<br><br>1. Dita strips in a martini glass<br><br>2. BDSM striptease with a Russian dominatrix<br><br>3. A woman is caught in a spider's web<br><br>4. A little woman rides a motorcycle, and strips<br><br>5. Dita swings on a disco ball, bursts glitter onto the crowd<br><br>6. Black Pearl pulls a Josephine Baker<br><br>7. Romeo ends up in in fishnets <br><br>8. Dita dances in a makeup powder case<br><br>9. Dita disrobes in an opium den<br><br>After the show we gamble and quickly lose $80. Next we walk to Drink & Drag, a bar run by drag queens. We are given a free round of drinks because they seem to think one of us is cute stuff. We take a 4 am bus to the airport. We fall asleep and miss the airport stop. We ask the driver what to do and he insults for missing our stop; leaving us worried. He didn't feel the need to mention that we were about to hit the end of the line and turn around. We are back at the airport in a few minutes. Jerk.	36.170579, -115.143704	May 9, 2012	May 9, 2012			1														
Los Angeles	Centerfold	2	x	We are in town to attend a vintage clothing expo. We arrive and hit the quaint convention center. I find a 60's silk tie with Marilyn Monroe's Playboy centerfold printed on it. We go to Jesse Meekers apartment in Hollywood and hang with him and his gf a while. The four of us head to Universal Studios together. We don't actually go into the part, but we walk around the fake downtown for a bit. Afterward have some nice potato dumplings in Burbank. That evening we attend a gong karaoke, where judges bang a big gong if you're bad. The first performer kills it with a rendition of Leo Sayer's "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing". In a few rounds I go up and try to sing John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy. The intro (33 bars of hand clapping) throws me off and I don't hit a single word. They let me stay on for a little while because I start unbuttoning my shirt, but eventually I get the gong.	33.978301, -118.468688	May 5, 2012	May 6, 2012	Jesse Meeker		1														
Salt Lake City	Slopes	1	x	I am here to attend the Western Region Music Therapy Association conference. I spend most of my days learning about iPad interventions for toddlers with special needs and participating in drum circles. I visit a rad punk bar with Kim. SLC Punk apparently is a thing. I don't make my stand-by flight going back. I reach out to Tim, Emily, and Emily, who mentioned they were going to stick around to ski. They don't mind me tagging along so I join them on the slopes for the day. I stay the night on Emily's couch and she drives me to the airport the next morning.	40.581017, -111.657363	Mar 28, 2012	Mar 30, 2012	Kim Headlee		1
