Our first leg lands us at O\'Hare, where we spend the day working and eating the free food in the Admirals Club. Ryan shows up at around 3 and warns us of the danger that lies ahead. He informs us that he offended chef Michael at PDC last time he was there by calling the food mediocre and that he is now on a mission to destroy all our bodies. We catch our second leg to Montreal. We get a car to the hotel and clean up for just a few before heading to Milky Way for a few rounds of cocktails and shots of Canadian Club. It\'s very late and we\'re all feeling peckish so we stop for McDonald\'s before heading to bed.<br><br>We take our time getting up before hopping on the train to Beauties. We\'re short on time before our lunch reservation, so we just grab a lox bagel sandwich and eat it on the street. There is a heap of sliced onion, big juicy tomatoes, capers, smear, and salmon on a slightly crunchy, chewy sesame bagel. A great start (not counting McDonald\'s) to our food tour. We catch a car to McKiernan, a warehouse restaurant in an industrial part of town, which specializes in roast chicken. We start with a yummy macerated wine before ordering albacore croquettes with beurre blanc, Brussels Sprouts with bleu cheese, a prime rib donut sandwich, and a charcuterie ragu. For dessert we end with a maple glaze donut and an apple pie cheesecake filled donut. These donuts are 10/10 perfection. We walk a lot, check out the local herbs, and explore the beautiful city. After a couple of hrs make our way to Vin Papillon for a bunch of very nice wine plus anchovie & butter on house focaccia; tuna crudo with orange & herbs; ham, hard cheese & brown butter; butternut squash donuts brushed with honey and dipped in fondue. From there we try for Atwater, but the line is long so we head to PDC for a shot of Calvados plus maple G&Ts. Next we take a bus to Mon Lapin. They greet us warmly and feed us cured duck & butter sandwiches; partially dehydrated carrots in smoked oyster mayonnaise; leeks with eel; potato puree with potato gratin topped with uni; beef tartare with kale & egg yolk; bread with sweet butter and oil; ricotta balls with black truffle; priest strangler noodle ragu;  fermented chanterelle sausage with oyster mushroom and sherry sauce; chicken with sourdough skin and chicken liver pate; honeynut squash with nuts & adoiulle sausage with pepitas; endive with frozen shaved froie gras; pear ginger pavlova; lingonberry infused cream; plus a fuck ton of good wine, digestives, and brandy. Ryan warns us that this is actually the lighter food day...<br><br>I don\'t remember going home. I think we were very drunk. We sort out doing our COVID tests via video chat. At around 12 we make our way to Arthur\'s Nosh Bar. We put our name on the list and walk across the street to Campanelli for coffee and pan au chocolat. A cute little dog comes up to our table to say hi. At Arthur\'s we share pancakes, beef bacon, spicy fried chicken with maple syrup, latkas, challah, a chicken schnitzel sandwich, and a Caesar (Bloody Mary) topped with a mini lox bagel sandwich. It snowed beautifully while we were eating and now the streets are quiet and covered in white. We stop by a market to pick up some wine and head back to the hotel for a bit to nap. A few hours later we are up and head out for the Cloakroom, but they are full so we head to The Coldroom for some okay cocktails. After a train and some walking we get a few bagels from St-Viateur and then walk on a bit more to PDC. Maple martinis. Venison hand roll with quail egg yolk drizzle. Foie gras nigri with shoyu peanut sauce. Pork tongue with tarragon. Creamy fish dip with black pepper potato chips. Andouilette on mashed potatoes. Foie gras mapo dofu. Old hen with spaetzle, potatoes, and cream sauce. Half of a big trout with a basically melted butter sauce. Rack of venison with a demi-glaze and browned butter. Maple caramel creme.

I eat a spicy shrimp dish, finish The Sparks Brothers, and play a lot of Breath of the Wild. We land, get a Soul, and head tj the condo to meet the gang; Anne, Richard, Gene, and Tina. They have been here for a while on holiday. When we were planning out trip out we decided to stay here with them. We start the good times off with a yummy coconut rum and passion fruit libation. There\'s still a few hours before dinner, so we head out to a nearby beach which is known to have good coral. We get suited up and jump in. We immediately see loads of fish of all sorts of colors and beautiful coral formations, which house both black and red pencil sea urchin. We only do about 20 or so minutes in the water before getting out to dry off and head back. Back at the condo everyone showers and celebrates with another drink before making out way to Papa Kona, an American food restaurant in Downtown Kona which features a live 2-piece music set. They do top 40 covers and the woman has a nice voice. Though the food is unremarkable the company is lovely. I am surprised at how westernized everything is here. I don\'t know that I saw a single native Hawaiian person all day. It feels more like visiting a tropical version of Southern California than a Polynesian island. It\'s about 3am Dallas time when we get home from dinner so we all head pretty much straight to bed.<br><br>I wake up at 5 and play some Zelda for a bit. Once everyone is up we all sit out on the patio and have coffee with the Kirkland version of Bailey\'s. The condo overlooks a forested area which sounds and looks like it\'s teeming with wildlife. I see quite a few birds, which I can identify as birds. A mongoose runs into the forest. Gene tells me that mongooses we\'re brought to the island to eat the rats, which were feeding on the sugarcane. Unfortunately, they didn\'t help much with the rats, but did significantly hurt local bird populations. We all pack up for s day at the beach. Tina makes us wraps with chicken, cucumber, and Branson Pickle. We drive north for about 50 minutes through a black lava lunar landscape before arriving at this isolated oasis of green, which they call \'A Beach\'. I pretty quickly hop in the water with a snorkel mask and explore the reef. The water is quite choppy and murky today, but I am able to still see a good variety of colorful babes. Before long I find myself next to a sea turtle whose shell is roughly the size of a Thanksgiving turkey serving dish. We both float casually and inspect one another for a couple of minutes before parting on good terms. A little further on I find a bright orange bit of live Coral which houses a large family of black and white clown fish. As I swim up they quickly hide away in the brain-like structure, but soon make their way cautiously back out to resume their business of whatever it was they were doing before. I get out, head back, and swap the snorkel for the inflatable paddle board. I do a quick test run and see a group of turtles from above. Because the wind is so strong I can really only paddle in one direction. I land and decide to go further out this time and with Liz. I paddle her around like a gondolier and it is very nice. After some hammock relaxing we pack up and start to head back. As we\'re walking back to the parking lot Tina points out a cat sanctuary in a large tree/cave area. We see quite a few cats and make friends. Back to the condo for a quick clean up (and cocktail) before walking to Don the Beachcomber, a very pretty tiki-esque hotel bar. Drinks are Mai Tais and Lava Flows. For food we all share plates of coconut shrimp, poke nachos, regular nachos, buffalo fries, pork tacos, and calamari. It\'s is all very yummy and we are treated with a pretty nice sunset too. Back and immediately to bed.<br><br>More Bailey\'s coffee. Tina makes us banana pancakes. We don\'t have plans for today, but Tina convinces us to make the trek to the Volcano park. It\'s a lot of driving and not much extra time so we head out pretty quickly. We first make for the southern most point of the US. There\'s a fair crowd out there. The cliffs are quite pretty and the water is crystal clear. There are a few wooden platforms overlooking the water. These are used for cliff diving. About 20 meters back from the cliff is a hole in the ground leading to a beautiful, rough water chamber. We drive on s bit to visit the southern most bakery in the US. We get a chocolate custard doughnut and a lily koi doughnut. They are both very good with a firm crust and chewy dough. Onward to the volcano park. We first do a point on the north rim of the caldera, which has some pretty views of bright yellow sulfur vents. We drive east and south, then take a mile hike to another viewing platform. From here we can see lava spewing up from a pit in the ground. It is pretty awesome to see. We find out our flight will be delayed a few hours. Just a minute up the road we stop by the lava tube, which is essentially a 1/4 mile-long underground tube. It\'s pretty cool, but the real treat is the rain forest hike to it. We pick up some Maui onion chips and water from a general store and hit the road back to Kona. This time we take the saddle road that cuts across the center of the island. About two hours later we are at Umeke, a seafood restaurant which specializes in poke. We get Hawaiian oysters Rockefeller, poke with rice & kimchi cucumber, and poke nachos, which are even better than last night\'s nachos. It is very good and very filling. We make back to the condo where we get to sneak in a few games of sequence before taking ourselves plus Anne and Richard to the airport. We sleep the whole flight then go straight to work.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"19.625436 -155.984434","From":"Nov 5, 2021","To":"Nov 8, 2021","People":"Anne, Richard, Gene, Tina","Locations":"Hawaii","NumberInTrip":"","One":"19.914197 -155.887339","Two":"19.625436 -155.984434","Three":"18.910416 -155.680801","Four":"19.401776 -155.265570","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/879D3ydwkV76nuBCA"},{"City":"Napa","Trip":"Jessica Wedding","Id":265,"Photo":"","Description":"I didn\'t take notes for this trip, but on Friday we saw Slow Gherkin in San Francisco, on Saturday we attended Jessica & Drew\'s wedding in Napa, and on Sunday we ate at French Laundry.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"38.404403 -122.364979","From":"Aug 24, 2018","To":"Aug 26, 2018","People":"Jessica, Drew, Millers","Locations":"San Francisco, Napa","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"San Francisco","Trip":"Jessica Wedding","Id":264,"Photo":"x","Description":"To the fancy hotel where we brush our teeth.

After a bit of that, we head to the condo to get looking fresh and then head to PS. We try to get into Bootleggers, but even at 3:30 they are already packed so we head to Tonga Hut. It is quite charming and the drinks are all very good. Straight to the reception from there where we catch up with Uncle Michael and Nancy, Justin, Jake, and about 150 of Mom & Jim\'s closest friends. After some chicken dinner and getting to hear Justin\'s rendition of She Thinks My Tractor\'s Sexy we mingle the night away.<br><br>I wake up quite early to drop Justin and the family at the airport. Coffee and a sandwich and then back to Liz. At around 10 we head to Mom\'s where we hang with them plus Michael and Nancy for a few hours. Mom bought us tickets to a special tour of the Frey House II, so we head out for that. It\'s a small, minimalist, yet absolutely beautiful home of the architect Albert Frey. I knew nothing of him coming in, but learn that he had an incredible talent for designing very iconic buildings which were very pragmatic and fitted to their environment. After about 40 minutes of exploring the 800 sq foot home nestled just up the mountain and learning loads about the fascinating man from some very informative docents, we head back down to the Palm Springs Art Museum. Free entry was included with our tour so we take in the modest, yet very charming space. We are especially enthralled by the native landscape works and by the glass exhibition. We head down the street to the Architecture wing of the museum, which is featuring an exhibition chair design. There are some real beauties. Next stop is Bootlegger, where our bartender makes us some delicious concoctions as well as offering fun conversation. It\'s getting late so we start to head back, but not before grabbing some Del Taco, which hits the spot.<br><br>We work most of the day from the kitchen. In the evening Jim & Mom take us to Big Rock, sort of a one-off Hard Rock with some better food. We meet Justin, Michelle, and their four kids, who are a hoot.

Our driver gives us the scoop on some good local foods to try, like rajas poblanos, sauteed poblanos with onions and crema. We get in and meet Greg, Andrew, and Veritay. Our room isn\'t ready yet so we wander the grounds for a bit. After walking right by a peacock we spot a cute little mix between a cat and a racoon, which is called a Coati. Within minutes we see many more. We stop into the lunch buffet for some yummy Mexican including rajas poblanas, which is really good. We check into the room and cool down for a bit. At around 7 we get dressed for the white party and head out. We immediately bump into Evelyn and Greg and find that the plans have changed. We walk instead to dinner where we dine on Mediterranean with the Three C\'s, Caitlyn, Christina, and Carrie. From there we all migrate to the lounge bar, where we mingle with April, Rose, Angela, Adrianne, Jason, Haxter. After some snacks from the cafe we head to bed.<br><br>Liz isn\'t feeling 100% so I head out on my own for a bit. I immediately bump into Rose and we chat for a few. Though the resort is a good size, it seems that every time I walk out the door I bump into someone I know. I head a few minutes south to the beach. As I pass over the mangrove boardwalk I see dozens of coati running around. Many of them are quite young and they all are adorable. I get a drink and a chair before settling in for a bit. After some light reading I hop in the warm blue-green water and play with the waves. I chat with the Three C\'s for a bit and also catch up with April and Angela. The three of us meet Liz for lunch at the same buffet as yesterday. From there, Liz and I check out the beach and the secret pool for a bit before heading back to the room to get cleaned up for the wedding. Once we\'re looking spiffy we head back to the beach for the ceremony. The weather is perfect and the sun is low in the sky. It is a very beautiful ceremony. Just as they are able to walk back down the isle as husband and wife I hear a live mariachi band strike up just behind me. Next thing I know the air is filled with bubbles. It is a wonderland. We all drink bubbles and take photos on the beach in the sunset light. When the sun goes down we migrate to the convention center for the reception. Drinks, dinner, dancing, photo booth. We sit with Andrew, Veritay, Adrianne, Jason, and Franz. Jason gives us a homemade treat for later. Evelyn straps a GoPro to a bottle of tequila, stands up on a chair, and pours it into the mouths of many of the guests. We dance so good. I haven\'t danced this much or this hard in years and it feels so good. Back to the lounge bar for more drinks and good times. They head to the beach, but I\'m wiped and call it.<br><br>First we head to the convention center to get our covid tests. To the breakfast buffet where we munch on chiliques, tacos, and more goodies. From there we book a tour of Tulum which includes visits to archeological sites and a visit to a cenote (sinkhole pool). We catch up with Adrianne and Jason for a bit longer and head back to the room. We snack on some treats and watch Night of the Teese, a burlesque spectacle. Over to the beach we find some nice chairs and fall in love with the fractal clouds. My filters are off. I\'m feeling the breeze, the birds, the water, the sounds, my gums, my stomach, my eyelids. When I\'m ready I wade into the choppy water and dance ballet with the waves. Three C\'s let us know that the slides will be closing soon so we head over there to have a few more wild rides. A good bit of the wedding crew is there and are cheering people on as they scream and shout their way down the chutes. Once last call is over we head to the pool bar. Evelyn hands us a GoPro and asks us to film ourselves jumping into the pool. I hold the camera while Liz and I jump in together. Immediately after she gently informs me that she just ripped off her big toe nail. She doesn\'t want to cause a scene and ruin the good vibes so we quietly get out and sit her down. It\'s pretty rough looking and apparent that she needs medical attention. I ask the staff for some assistance. Before long we are at the on-site medical clinic with a nurse. She is telling us that the nail needs to come off, but that she doesn\'t have the tools to do it. She recommends getting a taxi to Playa del Carmen and finding a clinic to do it. Liz wants to just wait until we are back in the US to have the procedure done, which is two days from now. The nurse implies that is not a good idea. After a bit of discussion we decide to cut our trip early and fly back first thing tomorrow morning to get it cared for. The nurse bandages her up and doesn\'t charge us, which is incredibly kind of her. We head back to the room for a bit to process everything that just happened. After sorting some logistics for a bit we decide to head to the Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. We weren\'t able to get reservations, but we thought we\'d just try our luck. We get a ride over to the resort, which is two over from ours, but within the same complex. This is clearly the posh hotel and it is stunning. It\'s a massive covered tile lobby with a large sun-tiled dome. There are massive cast clam shells (Venus De Milo esque) with humongous cuttlefish serving as the columns. Further on the smooth tiled floors drop straight into a shallow, tropical looking pool. It\'s dark out, but there is some subtle lighting. As we approach the pool, we find a black swan standing on an island about ten meters from us. Another few dozen meters past her we spot a flamboyance of flamingos. It is as majestic as it sounds. We walk onward to the restaurant. Our luck holds out and, within a few minutes, we are sat at a table drinking red wine and eating buttery garlic bread. Before long the servers are bringing by skewers of crispy chicken thighs, juicy tenderloin, seasoned sausages, spare ribs, and cinnamon-rubbed pineapple. It is a feast and doesn\'t take long for us to tap out. Back to the hotel we pack for a few and then head to the lobby bar for some reconnecting, meeting new folks like Natalie and Frank, karaoke (I sing Tenderness), and final goodbyes.<br><br>We get just a few hours sleep before an early trip to the airport.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"20.756107 -86.958137","From":"Oct 1, 2021","To":"Oct 4, 2021","People":"Evelyn, Greg, Rose, Angela, April, Adrianne, Jason, Andrew, Veritay, Caitlyn, Christine, Carrie, Natalie","Locations":"Playa Paraiso","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/wBJuq5y7o1SW6v2v8"},{"City":"Naples","Trip":"Just for Fun","Id":261,"Photo":"x","Description":"We take a long and windy mountain road to Naples. Liz booked us a funky hotel in a funky part of town. Driving and parking is pretty stressful. I manage to navigate some incredibly tight alleys. She\'s not feeling well from the heat so I head out solo for a while to take in the city. This city makes me think of Berlin in the 90s or probably Portland now. It\'s dirty and poor and totally alive. I eat unknown fried food on the cobblestone and and buy a Aperol spritz from a man selling alcohol from a table in front of an unmarked door. It seemed to be pretty normal. I watch an old woman let her dog take a big shit in the middle of a busy pedestrian area and walk away. Liz still isn\'t feeling well so I grab a margherita pizza with some fried foods to go from Matteo, a beer from the street guy, plus a cannoli and head back to the room to eat some very yummy food.<br><br>The ac control doesn\'t work so the machine pumps out very chilly air until I cut the power and then a few hours later get hot an turn it back on. We get up late. Downstairs at a cafe, a man with \\"I fucking hate you\\" tattooed on his thigh asks for the time. We pass by a shop of curiosities. It is closed, but we are entranced by the window display featuring many busts of a blindfolded Lady Fortune, statues of the Devil, and bronze penises. To Matteo for a fritta, which is basically a deep fried pizza with crust on both sides. It is messy and delicious. The cool looking church is already booked for the day so we head north to Piazza Bellini where a man pulls up on a bicycle with a PA attached playing The Boss, by The Braxtons. This city is covered in graffiti and street art. Next up to Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Nipoli, where we are a bit let down to find the Gabinetto Segreto (secret cabinet), full of ancient erotic art from Pompei, has already closed for the day. We do take in some lovely mosaics that are old enough to make the Rembrandt seem like a contemporary of Ai Wei Wei. Up to the second floor, the main hall is featuring an extensive exhibit about gladiators, covering everything from the arena architecture, to the warriors clothing and diet, to the different weaponry and fighting styles, to the politics of funding an event. It is very educational and interesting. Next is a massive model and rooms of artifacts from Pompei. Frescoes from there and then we\'re feeling pretty done. The museum is not air conditioned and by the end Liz is starting to feel unwell. We walk back to the hotel and Liz lies down for a few hours to recuperate. At around 10:30 we head out. Sorbillo still has a long line out front so we opt for something less conspicuous. We get a Diavolo and a Romana pizza. They are both unmemorable. To bed.<br><br>Up early and we hit the road to Pompei. Everything goes smoothly and before long we\'re ready for our tour with Guillermo and a kind Italian couple. He is incredibly informative on both Italian history and metal music. He teaches is an Italian sign for casting out bad spirits, which Ronnie James Dio learned from his grandmother, started using at concerts and became the standard metal \\"sign of the Devil\\". Guillermo tells us that in 79 ad the volcano shot 200,000 tons of ash and debris per second for about two days. The cloud of junk shot 40km into the sky and, becuase of the direciton of the wind, landed right on top of Pompei and the surrounding area. Considering the city had a volcano explode onto it and was covered in fifteen meters of debris and ash for nearly two millennium it\'s in remarkable condition. Many of the frescoes within people\'s homes are still clearly visible. The city is vast and would take days to really explore, but he takes us on a greatest hits tour of some well-preserved amphitheaters, streets, homes, shops, brothels, temples, casted bodies, political signs, mosaics, frescoes, phallic objects, baths, pots, fountains, architectural features, and the acropolis. The word used for brothel here is \'lupanare\', which essentailly translates to \'wolf den\'. He suggests is was called that because the prostitutes would howl on the stree corners to attract attention. We have a great time and learn a lot. On top of that, the weather was fairly cool and the crowd was pretty quiet today. We purchase a flying penis ornament and head to the parking lot, which has a restaurant attached and offered a discount for us eating there. My initial expectations weren\'t high, but holy hell it was good. We started with a charcuterie board of mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, ricotta, salami, prosciutto, and lardo. Liz very accurately described the mozzarella being cut as \\"weeping milk\\". The main was a damn fine calzone stuffed with ham, ricotta, and mozzarella, and mushrooms. Pompei was so great that we decide to also visit Ercolano, a smaller coastal town west of Visuvus which was better preserved than Pompei due to it receiving mainly ash deposit. It is so well preserved and reconstructed that it doesn\'t even feel real. The scale of time that were seeing is so much further than any habitable structures we\'ve seen in America, the UK, or  Japan. These don\'t feel like ancient ruins, like Stonehenge, these are relatable. There are kitchens, stoves, baths, shops, gardens, bedrooms, paintings and so much that makes it feel very real and very immediate. I don\'t have to try very hard to imagine people living and breathing here. I learn that many people ran to the docks on the coast with the hope of surviving. However, the 30 km cloud of heat and ash which the poured down on the town didn\'t care about the coastline; in fact, it extended the coast out another 1.5 km. The docks we saw were filled with skeletons. There is no way to transition these two things, but next we drive to see the Fendi headquarters building, which is known as the \\"square coliseum\\". It sits alone at the top of a hill and is beautiful. Next we drive to Fumicino where after checking into the hotel, we head for dinner at a riverside seafood restaurant. The salmon tartare with raspberries is pretty weird, but the slapping pasta with sea bass and the katsu tuna steak are pretty awesome. I try taking the wine bottle out of its ice pack and accidentally knock my glass off the table doing so. It all happens pretty slowly, but Liz watches the whole thing go down without taking her lips off of her glass. A group of kids next to us is being pretty annoying playing hide-and-seek around our table. We make some understanding gestures with an older woman sitting next to us. Before we know it, she is telling Liz, in French, that she is an ambassador of orphan (often?) children and has a villa in Tunisia. She stops the playing children and forces them to apologize to us. Then, we\'re not entirely sure, but we think she guilts the restaurant into giving us a free disgestivo for our troubles.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"40.851208, 14.257964","From":"Sep 8, 2021","To":"Sep 10, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino","NumberInTrip":"","One":"40.750239, 14.486884","Two":"40.804446, 14.347535","Three":"40.851208, 14.257964","Four":"41.771630, 12.231103","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69"},{"City":"Amalfi Coast","Trip":"Just for Fun","Id":260,"Photo":"x","Description":"I start the day with a cappuccino downstairs. Even though we leave 20 minutes early, we still aren\'t able to make our train on time. Everything here seems to take quite a bit longer than we\'re used to. We get the car and they \\"upgrade\\" (ie they were out of the other cars) us to an automatic, which I am quite relieved to learn. I spend the next three hours cussing out asshole drivers that might actually be worse than Texans. I think the general mentality here is that the larger your vehicle is the more you get to ignore that other cars exist. The first two hours are on larger autostrada and the final hour involves skirting the jagged coastline with vehicles hell-bent on treating the narrow roads like a race track. Once at Atrani, Carlo helps lug the bags up many flights of narrow stairs to our room with an absolutely charming view of the town. We are pretty wiped and nap for a bit. Around 6 we get up. Just as we are about to head out a burst of wind, rain and lightning hit and keep us locked in for a while longer. Fortunately, the view of the storm is spectacular. When the sky slows to a steady trickle we brave the outdoors. Down the stairs and through the mountain passageway and we are dropped right in the middle of Almafi. We stop for a gelato when the rains pick up again. We window shop our way up the charming main street until the shops close. Back down the street and through the tunnel to La Palma where we dine in white wine, mussels, fries, linguine with anchovy garum, and local fish with \\"crazy sauce\\". The meal and weather work together to create a lovely evening. We end with a limoncello and head back to the room for some nice times.<br><br>We check out and catch a ferry to Positano, where we will spend the next two hours exploring the touristy, but still quaint town. We buy a nice lemon painted serving dish for my mom\'s wedding present and dine on a delicious lemon custard tart cup. Back to Amalfi where we pick up a cute lemon ornament, put down a panino, gobble granita, and buy some booze.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"40.635940, 14.608523","From":"Sep 7, 2021","To":"Sep 8, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino","NumberInTrip":"","One":"40.635940, 14.608523","Two":"40.634807, 14.602011","Three":"40.629530, 14.486382","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69"},{"City":"Rome","Trip":"Just for Fun","Id":259,"Photo":"x","Description":"We both got COVID tests two days ago, but I still haven\'t received my results as the plane is boarding. We opt not to risk landing without results so head back home and decide to try again tomorrow.<br><br>This time we have scheduled rapid tests at the airport. We get them and get on the flight. The woman sitting next to me does a sharp sniff about every 5-10 seconds for the entire 10-hour flight. I don\'t sleep. On the train into town there are miles of blocks of worn-looking apartment buildings; all about 9 stories tall. There\'s lots of graffiti. Some of it is quite good. One piece features a demon giving us the middle finger. We pass under an aqueduct. Walking out of the metro we see the Spanish Steps to our right. There are many of them and they look very pretty. We arrive at the very charming Hotel Mozart at around 11. Our room is ready so we decide to lie down for just a few minutes...we finally force ourselves out of bed at 3. We hit the pavement and walk down a small but crowded street with many shops. After about 15 minutes walking south we pass by a promising restaurant called Osteria Bacco where we enjoy Aperol spritzes, artichoke (in both the Roman and Jewish styles), fried squash blossom with mozzarella and anchovy, and a beef carpaccio with rosemary and black truffle. Fabio, our server, is an absolute gem and recommends a white dessert wine from Umbria, where he is from. It is less sweet than a Vin Santo and has pleasing notes of mineral and honey. With the wine, he also serves us a special type of almond biscotti called a cantucci, which pairs particularly well with the wine. We walk not even two minutes to Trevi Fountain, which is gorgeous. It feels like Las Vegas. In a few more minutes we stop at a restaurant bar for some espresso. We spend the next two hours meandering our way by the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, the Jewish neighborhood, and a dizzying array of beautiful buildings, streets, corners, shops, and bistros. At around 8 we arrive at Da Enzo to find a line about three times the capacity of the restaurant and decide to head towards Tonnarello, a place one of Liz\'s colleagues recommended. The wait here is a much more reasonable twenty minutes. We start with a bottle of Chianti and a few cestino, which are essentially Roman arancini. Dinner is cacio e pepe and amatriciana (guanciale, tomato, pecorino). The spaghetti is pleasantly thick and chewy on both. The cacio e pepe is very good, but doesn\'t quite meet our memory of last time. The amatriciana is cheesy, salty, and incredible. We chat with our neighbor, Phillip from Birmingham (Alabama), for a good bit before taking an exciting cab ride back to the hotel and crashing.<br><br>We were meant to head to Naples today, but car rentals are completely booked, so we opt to spent another day in Rome. We drink a few cappuccinos at the cafe next door while we plan our day. Next we head to a grocery down the street for some pistachio butter, licorice treats, and cantuccini. For lunch we head south, past the Spanish Steps, to Piccolo Buco. The appetizer is two anchovies sitting atop a few curls of butter all on a single piece of toast. It is absolute perfection. Pizza 1 is four cheese with a yellow tomato sauce. Pizza 2 is fried cubed eggplant with local sliced mozzarella on red sauce. This is a unique style of pizza where the crust under the sauce part is almost paper thin and the edge crust is a massive pillow of crispy deliciousness. Back to the hotel again to drop the leftovers off. Liz is feeling a bit tired and decides to take a nap. I rent an electric standing scooter and head towards the Vatican. The streets are very bumpy and it\'s an exciting ride. I arrive at the city walls only to be told that they are closed for the rest of the day. I loop around the entire country before heading back across the water to the antique shop-heavy neighborhood. We are on the hunt for some sweet mid-century Italian cocktail glasses. No luck at the 8 or so shops visit, but a lovely purveyor tells me the story of Romelus and Remus when she sees me eyeing a statue of two babies suckling the teets of a massive wolf. I wait in the beautiful square for a few minutes until Liz meets me. We walk together south to Trastevere and get in line for Da Enzo. The line is quite long, but we somehow make it in the first seating. To start we order a carafe of the house red with a plate of pre-pulled burrata. It is almost soup-like from all of the cream and the strands of cheese twirl around my fork like fettuccine. We order the same pastas as last night: cacio e pepe and amatriciana. Wow wow wow. Last night was great, but these are both superlative. The cacio e pepe has LOTS of coarse fresh ground pepper on top and throughout which gives a pleasing, almost menthol brightness that cuts through the creaminess of the cheese. For the amatriciana they use a rigatoni pasta, which is a perfect little train car for transporting the thick, cheesy sauce and gives a delightful surprise with each bite. The red sauce is umami-rich and carries notes of sharp cheese and pork fat. The guanciale is cut into little rectangular sheets and seared crispy to house the unearthly flavor. Somehow we convince ourselves that we have room for tiramisu, which I don\'t regret one bit. The cocoa powder is topped heavily just before serving, the custard has a rich eggy texture, and there\'s a soft chocolate dollop near the bottom. All that plus a coffee-soaked lady finger on the side makes for the perfect ending. After a long stroll winding our way north through the city streets, we are back at the hotel where we crash for a bit. At midnight we get up to watch Eric Weirheim make orange chicken.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"41.835522, 12.465640","From":"Sep 4, 2021","To":"Sep 7, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino","NumberInTrip":"","One":"41.835522, 12.465640","Two":"40.634807, 14.602011","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69"},{"City":"St Louis","Trip":"Ranch Life","Id":258,"Photo":"x","Description":"We get a ride from the airport to Catalyst for an okay cold brew and some okay art.

After an hour of trains and getting bumped into by folks (personal space seems to be a thing of the past here) we arrive at Moxy Bastille. Our room isn\'t ready, so we do some quick cleaning up. We are surprised to find a text from Melvin saying he is at the brunch restaurant waiting for us (we mistakenly thought the plan was to meet tomorrow). We rush out and meet them about 20 min later. They had given up on the boat restaurant because the food looked crap. We walk a few minutes instead to a charming tiny place where we sip on nice coffee and catch up. Shortly our Benedict and savory burrata french toast arrives and we chow down on that for a good bit. Alexia tells us of her new passion in wound care. From there, Melvin shows us down a narrow, cafe-lined street which he calls \\"Vieux Paris\\". It\'s sort of a cleaner French version of Piss Alley. Alexia leaves to go visit with her brother. I buy some peacock stationary. Moments later we walk by a specialty shop selling only canned seafood from Belle Isle. Only a few more moments later I get pajamas from Muji. Walking again we see protestors protesting. Melvin then leads us for about 20 minutes to Bon Marche, a classy and beautiful department store & food market. We try on lovely cologne at Le Labo and gawk at the furniture upstairs before exploring the food hall. We sit down at the patisserie and share a Paris Brest, an apple tart, and a Tarte Tropézienne. We part ways. On the train, a woman is either preaching or begging. She pulls out an egg shaker and makes an absolute mockery of what is probably a decent a French tune with her lazy, meandering voice. Back to the hotel. We are both nearly delirious with exhaustion and sleep until the sun is low in the sky. Just before sunset we muster the energy to walk the 400 meters to Chez Janou. David recommended this place based I think solely on the fact that they serve chocolate mousse from a comically large bowl. We didn\'t necessarily have the highest expectations for anything but the mousse. As it turned out though, the atmosphere, service, wine, mussels, steak, and mousse were all very lovely. We walk back and go straight to sleep.<br><br>Eventually we eat breakfast, shower and head out. Our first stop is Fringe for a to-go cold brew. Onto Ladurée where we pick up macrons for Rob & Tony. We also stay for an orange blossom macron and a St Honour, a mountain of whipped cream atop a mound of vanilla custard and brulee pastry. Liz orders in French. Elle est parfaite. Le Metro. We stop by the newly renovated La Samaritaine to appreciate the ornate iron staircase and partake in the photomaton. A little further on and we\'re at the Louvre. We descend into the glass pyramid, use the facilities, snack on some Paul, and begin. First stop is the Greek sculpture hall to appreciate Liz\'s favorite piece: Cupid reviving Psyche. We get a bit lost, but soon make our way up to Mona Lisa. After a nap on a bench we head through the rooms of Louis XIV and Napoleon, filled with hanging tapestries, scarlet wallpaper, golden pocket watches, long dining tables, Egyptian booty, lacquered cabinets, marble penises, and, of course, a dragon\'s hoard worth of paintings. Paintings depicting wars, revolutions, coronations, monkeys stealing fruit, Greek heroes (including the same scene we saw earlier of Cupid and Psyche), capitalist armadas, Jesus, clothed women, partially clothed women, nude women, angles, daemons, and countless cherubs. Two trains later we are back at the hotel for a deep late-afternoon nap. When the sun is nearly down we get up, noodle around a bit, and hit the pavement. Earlier in the day we walked by our old haunt, Candelaria, and now it is calling our name. On the patio we dine on frozen margaritas, frijoles with chips, and a platter of duck confit mole tacos. We leave nothing behind. Into the back room for a Mango-Bango and a Royal Street. Our server is kind and allows us to choose whether we prefer to speak in French or English. This has actually happened numerous times on this trip already. There seems to be a newly found patience for budding Francophones amongst the Parisians.

It feels like quite a climb. There are tiny shrines, homes, shops, and cats dotted along the whole loop. At the opposite end of the island it a nice lookout about 100 ft over the water.

To the hotel, which is very country and modern and Texas. We relax in the room for a bit, take some ineffective drops and head down to the pool. Folk are packed tight in the water. After hawk-eyeing the chairs for a while we pounce on one, get s smoky margarita, and take a dip. Room, bubbles, and out to Thompson\'s basement.

We don\'t stay long enough to find out, but I suspect it will end in a shootout. The building appears to be the livestock transition pens. It is old and gorgeous and the train tracks run right through the middle of it. Now it is populated exclusively by novelty shops and BBQ restaurants.

I watch The Farewell and The Father, both of which are great, and then sleep a while. We check into the hotel, which has two cats. Liz has some difficulty changing shirts in the lobby. Bagels at Bagels & Beans. The man sitting next to us is making a lot of mouth sucking sounds and it\'s grossing me out. We walk to Centraal to catch an hour-long bus ride to Zaanse Schans, a traditional Dutch windmill village complete with windmills, cheese, and goats. We take our time taking it all in and taking pictures. The sky is a pale blue with a few puffy clouds dotted around and there is a hearty breeze breathing life into the big pinwheels. After walking up on side for a while we catch a ferry across the river and walk back down a quaint street. We stop in a pub, but after 10+ minutes without a server approaching us, we give up and leave. A cyclist asks for directions to a town we\'ve never heard of. We catch a bus then metro. A man waiting behind us on the train is making cuckoo whistles–apparently to encourage us to move quicker. First we eat frites with Andalouse, then we wait to buy cookies, and lastly return to the hotel. On the bed where we munch down a delicious dark cocoa cookie. It\'s crispy on the outside and nearly gooey in the center. There is a ribbon of milk chocolate running through the dough and a big lump of pillowy white chocolate smack in the middle. Then we crash. We wake up hours later and I don\'t know what day it is. We meet the guys by a leather bar and grab okay Italian. We share a cheese pizza with basil on top and sort of a pasta cabbage roll. Afterwards we sit on a bridge, drink beers, shares stories of our day, and watch the sun very slowly fade away. By 10:30 it\'s finally dark and we call it an evening. One more quick cone of frites on the way home and then to bed.<br><br>After a short walk in the beautiful morning air we are at Rum Baba where we share a superlative cold brew and oat cortado. We alternate sips with bites of the same chocolate cookies from yesterday. The combination of the cookie with cold brew creates a new taste, which is eerily similar to a margarita pizza. We walk northeast for about 15 minutes and arrive at the Katten Kabinet, a whimsical old building decorated with paintings of cats, statues of cats, and real-life cats. 6 minutes west and we are at our old haunt, Singel 404, for a burrata sandwich and a chicken, goat cheese, and tapenade sandwich. We pick up another six-pack of cookies to take home and then stop back at the hotel for a not so quick nap followed by a good touch. Walk and tram over to Brouwerij \'t IJ. I ask for the beer with the ostrich on it, which gives Liz a good chuckle (the ostrich is their logo and on every tap). We get a hapjesplank of sausage and cheese plus a few more beers, all of which are lovely. On the street a family of rats is sharing a loaf of bread. Oosterpark is just a few minutes away, so we head there. First we lie down for a bit by the lake where a couple of coots come to say hello. The sky is golden, a few couples are dancing on a raised stage, two men are practicing kickboxing, and another is playing a kora. After I fail to traverse a set of hanging rings and Liz gets pooped on by a bird we take a tram back to the hotel. We watch a few minutes of The Fall of the House of Usher before heading to meet Michael & David at Tales & Spirits for Milk Punch, Zombies, fried chicken and more.

It takes me a good while at least to lost my $10.<br><br>After a solid workout and a pretty good hotel breakfast we take the bus to the National Atomic Testing Museum where we learn about early atomic bomb design and the different test sites used in the US.

Unfortunately the pool is closing so we relax in the room for a bit before taking a very long and very raucous bus ride up to the Sahara where we have reservations for José Andreas\' Meat Bazaar. We order Ferran Adria olives, steak tartare, a 16oz chateaubriand, and very buttery potato purée. Liz is wiped and wants to head to bed. I am still alert so I explore Circus Circus, whose filth I adore; Resort World, a bland mall; and Excalibur, which is quite a bit nicer than I expected.<br><br>I walk to Eataly only to discover a ~50 person line with only one barista working. Back to Starbucks for breckie and then to the pool for a bit of sun, a nice swim, surprise ducks, and a magnum Piña Colada. Shower up and then we get a ride to Hell\'s Kitchen for foie gras, seared scallops, a Beef Wellington, and a sinful sticky toffee pudding. We walk down to Bally\'s where, after being enticed by some praise-giving french women trying to sell me $300 moisturizer, we play 18 holes of Twilight Zone themed mini golf. While the course design is a bit lackluster the decor is absolutely on point. There are many statues and murals depicting scenes from famous episodes. We follow that up with a few rounds of Twilight Zone pinball. From there we catch a bus to The Golden Tiki, which blows our minds. It might be the most well-designed tiki bar I\'ve ever seen. Our bartender described it as Disneyland on acid, which is not wrong. The door stall handles are brass dicks. We imbibe some very nice drinks plus coconut shrimp and perfect crab wontons. Another bus up to Herbs and Rye for some classic cocktails and a chat with Scotty, a bartender from Phoenix. A kind driver drops us off on Fremont street, which is hopping. I see as many men wearing thongs here as women. We pop quickly into Circa for a few hands of digital Blackjack before walking to Taqueria Casa Del Pastor for al pastor tacos and killer carne asada quesadilla. Though it\'s nighttime, the asphalt still radiates heat. An oven recently powered off. We eat while power walking to the Neon Museum. Holy cow this place is incredible; truly a treasure trove of bygone signage. Many of the pieces are wonderfully restored and all of them are arranged in such a way to give the sense of being in a dreamy cemetery of letters and limbs. Our guide gives good context for many of the works. We board a bus back to Fremont for more of giving Circa our money and then another bus back to the Tropicana.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"36.126057, -115.192238","From":"Jun 26, 2021","To":"Jun 29, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas","NumberInTrip":5,"One":"25.780652, -80.128626","Two":"39.965684, -75.181051","Three":"34.146892, -118.255722","Four":"33.397986, -111.480571","Five":"36.126057, -115.192238","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6"},{"City":"Phoenix","Trip":"Hubs","Id":249,"Photo":"x","Description":"Anne & Richard pick us up and take us home where we all spend a good while catching up. Lunch is bread, cheese, pâté, and sav blanc. Afterward we all tuck in for a good nap. A few hours later Phoebe comes over for some more nice hangouts. Anne makes a delicious fried calf liver, rashers, onions, potatoes and gravy. Richard goes to bed and Phoebe drops us off in downtown Gilbert at White Rabbit—a pretty hip and busy speakeasy. We have a couple rounds of fancy drinks including one that tasted like a Terry\'s chocolate apricot. We also snack on bacon wrapped figs and truffle Gouda mac.<br><br>The four of us head to Robbie\'s for Tristain\'s memorial service. Nikki, Dad, and a few others give some nice speeches and Jeremy reads a heartbreaking poem. Afterward we all snack on Macayo\'s and socialize. I meet Gedi and Suzanne. Chas and I discuss fermenting. Preston teaches me about the gameplay structure of Fortnite. Stetson gives me a firm pat on the back. Liz gest overheated so back at the house we all relax for a bit. Once we\'re up we squeeze in a short game of Catan where Anne sneaks in a steal literally at the buzzer. Over to Phoebe\'s for a bit to oogle her plants and cuddle Canon & Crusty. She takes us by In-n-Out before dropping us at the airport for our flight to Vegas. On the plane, before takeoff, a flight attendant asks a man if he\'s okay because she sees him shaking. He tells her he\'s okay, but that he\'s homophobic.

To the hotel where we rest ever so quickly before having to leave again. Traffic here moves very slowly and everything seems very far apart. It takes an hour to get to Glendale, even though it\'s only about 9 miles away as the crow flies. Liz tries on some cute sailor pants. We drive over to Glendale where we wander a mall for a bit to kill time until our dinner reservations at Sushi Sasabune. We both opt for the omakase, which turns out to be an excellent choice. The two tataki are killer as are the 12 nigiri they serve us. Just as we\'re about to leave a couple walks in. I comment to \\"She is stunning\\" to which Liz replies \\"She\'s Dita Von Teese\\"! Liz covers her face and cries tears of joy. We contemplate whether it\'s appropriate to say hi and after a few minutes decided yes. It is pretty short and sweet. Liz tells her about looking forward to ordering from her new site. Dita recommends a bar. We thank them and part ways. Neither of us can stop smiling for the next hour. We go straight to Bigfoot Lodge, the bar Dita recommended, which she accurately described as a rockabilly dive lodge. After a drink and our emotions settle down we go straight home and to bed.<br><br>I wake up early and work out. Then we drive down Melrose to Courage Bagels for a salmon bagel and a veggie bagel. They are both on \\"burnt everything\\" and are very likely the best bagels we\'ve ever eaten in our lives. West again to LACMA for some very good modern & contemporary by Kandinsky, Klee, Picasso, Léger, Pollack, Magritte, Kusama, Yoshitoshi and so many more. The museum is gorgeous and feels great to be in. Churro batter ice cream from the store and then a break at the hotel. After a particularly good touch we head to Santa Monica for some beach times. The shore is steep and the waves are aggressive. We hold hands, share memories, take pictures and get sandy. Next to Blossom Vietnamese for yummy spring rolls, noodle \\"salad\\", and sublime broth phó. We are both feeling pretty wiped so we opt to go back to the hotel where we fall straight into a deep sleep.<br><br>Primo Donuts for a great orange glaze cake baby before our flight to Phoenix.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"34.146892, -118.255722","From":"Jun 23, 2021","To":"Jun 25, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas","NumberInTrip":3,"One":"25.780652, -80.128626","Two":"39.965684, -75.181051","Three":"34.146892, -118.255722","Four":"33.397986, -111.480571","Five":"36.126057, -115.192238","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6"},{"City":"Philadelphia","Trip":"Hubs","Id":247,"Photo":"x","Description":"The hotel receptionist lets us check in waaay early, so that\'s nice. I try to clean out the hair-clogged sink, but am defeated. We stroll past the gorgeous and massive City Hall before sipping beans at La Colombe. Underground to the train and down to Pat\'s for a definitely better than Geno\'s cheese steak. The meat is tender and juicy and the bread feels fresh and not mass-produced. Little Saigon is just north, so we walk through that next—it\'s pretty run down and not as charming as we\'d hoped. A nice driver takes us to the Philadelphia Museum of Art where we spend the next few hours appreciating Duchamps, Picasso, Magritte, Van Gogh, Renoir, Rodin, along with a some older Flemish and Italian Renaissance masters who painted some trippy stuff. After a snack at Whole Foods we ride the bus to Fishtown. Contrary to what Dee Reynolds would have me believe it is surprisingly pleasant. At Pizzeria Beddia we eat beans in olive oil & lemon zest, bread with tomato sauce, and asparagus, shiitake, lemon & dill pizza. Afterward we pick up a few beers, head back to the hotel, and watch Minari.<br><br>We sleep in late, which is lovely. We kiss and celebrate being married for our favorite 8 years. Eventually we walk over to Reading Terminal Market where we pick up a pork roll breakfast sandwich, some Peking duck wraps, and a cannoli. After that I walk the shops, but don\'t find anything. I come back and work out. We are feeling lazy and hang for a while longer. We have an early reservation for Zahav so at 4 we head out. We sit at the bar and are immediately served all sorts of delicious salads (eggplant, beet, cabbage, carrot, fennel, green beans), hummus, and herb flatbread. We get some lovely drinks and continue to get bombarded with dishes like fried halloumi in honeysuckle syrup, carrot schnitzel, seared bass with tahini, grilled apricot, crispy rice, lamb shoulder in pomegranate sauce, and ice cream biscuit sandwiches. We meet Evelyn and Greg nearby for drinks at Sassafras. After a while there we head for a second round at Charlie Was a Sinner. They are both so lovely. Beers in bed.<br><br>Up at 4:30 to hopefully catch a flight.

Only about half of the urinals are occupied, but when I turn around I find someone waiting behind me for my stall. Leaving the airport, we see a big iguana on the side of road. To Moxy and then to Havana Viejo for mojitos, tostones (stuffed plantains), and mojo marinated pork leg. It is an auspicious beginning. We walk down the main drag near Miami Beach. This place feels like a non-stop party. Liz comments that it\'s like a beach Vegas where everyone is dressed like it\'s a pride parade. There are a lot of see-through pants. A lot of them. We bear the heat and walk to Time Out Market for a Rocher and coffee. Liz gets a beach hat from Goorin before we head back to the hotel for a deep sleep. Today is Angie\'s birthday, so we call her to catch up a bit. To Ceviche 105 for a trio of ceviches, fried corn nuts, and smoked lobster & plantain maki. Our final stop is Broken Shaker—a cocktail bar in a lush jungle environment. The bar has regularly been voted as on of the top 50 cocktail bars in the world. It definitely wasn\'t.<br><br>We munch down a pecan croissant and a guava cheese danish before hitting the beach. The water is pleasant, aqua-green and shallow with gentle waves. Only a few yards in front of us a man gets fully undressed before taking a dip. He doesn\'t look cold at all. Back to the mainland where we grab subs from Publix, which are delightful. Thanks Michelle! The art museum is full so we opt to wander Wynwood. This area is dense with local shops and galleries. Every wall has art on it. We get a lovely cold brew from Panther where an elderly Chad has a tantrum when they tell him there is no Splenda. Liz tries on some Ray Bans. We get caught in the rain while walking to grab a tamarindo mojito. Next we catch a ride to Little Havana for fritas—Cuban burgers with chorizo—at El Rey. After dinner we stroll down Calle Ocho and take in the neon set to some damn good live music before heading back. Liz sleeps and I practice drawing her.<br><br>The flight to Philadelphia is early. In the airport bathroom, two different times I see men who are unwilling to use an open urinal. They wait for a full empty urinal spacer to open up before going.

He is playing violin for the traffic. We check into our suite, crash for just a few, and catch a ride to Roma. The taco shop we want is closed. We walk for just a minute and find two nice ladies who make us biztec and campechano tacos, which are amazing. We wander from Roma to the park. A man is playing a type of small, hand-cranked nickelodeon and is having a blast doing it. We stop by a large fountain and gaze at the goddess Diana\'s incredible butt. We head into the park. Appreciate some clothes statues and then catch a cab to Quintonil. Our reservation is for 3:45. By 6, we are ten courses deep plus a hacienda margarita and a Ramos Gin Fizz. Everything is incredible. We explore a nearby square, visit a Sally store, and then sleep for 15 hours.<br><br>After a mediocre hotel breakfast we head to the anthropological museum. In the park outside the museum there is an exercise class doing Pulp Fiction esque dance moves to Rock around the Clock. A minute further along, we hear live flute and drum. We pass through the trees to see where it\'s coming from and find four men in elaborate costume hanging upside-down and spinning from a 100 foot pole. They are playing the music. As they spin, their ropes lower slowly towards the ground. It is called Danza de los Voladores, Dance of the Flyers. Next we do the museum, which is massive and stunning. There are a few temple facade reconstructions, which are particularly impressive. After tasty elotes, tlayudas, and horchata on the street we walk through the park for a good while. At one point we hear the same flute and drum music. We look around for another group of swinging men, but I don\'t see them. After a minute Liz pulls out her phone to realize she had the video of them playing in her pocket. We tire out and get a cab to Baltra, a cocktail bar in Roma. After a clarified horchata punch we walk through a park where a very talented man is doing Beatles covers with an elaborate one-man-band setup on his back. A al pastor vendor on the street grabs our attention and we dine on incredible street tacos. Next is Licoreria Limantour where, when we ask the host how long the wait will be, we are informed that time is relative, but probably around 30 minutes. After longer than that we give up and get a ride to Taqueria Los Cocuyos for tacos with mostly non muscle meats. I\'m not sure what we had, but at least one was tripa. They were good though. We walk for about 20 and land in Plaza Garibaldi, which is the center for mariachi music in the city. There are dozens of bands hanging out in full regalia. Many are playing for just one or two people. We take it all in for a while before settling on a nice looking Norteno group, who play us a groovy tune.<br><br>After a workout and a better breakfast we get a ride to Teotihuacan. We arrive at the gates an hour later to be told it is closed for the rest of the day because they already hit capacity. Our driver recommends a canal area on the south side of town so we go for it. Almost another hour and a half later we arrive. We get tacos from a stand and hop on a colorful boat. The canal is jam packed with other boats, but the weather is great, the vibes are great, and there\'s beer in a bucket. Various vendors in canoes who pull up along side us to offer their goods. A woman is frying tortillas in one. In another a man is roasting corn. Some canoes have mariachi bands who will board boats and play for passengers. One canoe has a DJ who appears to be shooting a music video. After about an hour of bumper boat madness we break off down a quiet canal. The whole experience is lovely and nowhere near the tourist trap I was worried it might be. Back to the hotel to put on some Plan 9 from Outer Space for just a bit. Hanky Panky for cocktails and snacks. Just as we are about to leave we meet Ali and Amy, US & Canadian nomads who have been bouncing between Turkey and Mexico since September. We close down the bar chatting with them.<br><br>Neither of is feels 100% today so we take it easy, get some more tacos, tepache, and a quesadilla from down the street, and make out way back home.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"19.418720, -99.167852","From":"Apr 16, 2021","To":"Apr 19, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Mexico City","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rp9QuWsmPHydD73S7"},{"City":"Yellowstone National Park","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":244,"Photo":"x","Description":"We nab the last spot at the Lewis Lake campsite and setup the tent. There is still a bit of light in the sky, so we drive to West Thumb, a hot spring and mud pot cluster. There are hundreds of craters in the ground ranging in size from toilet bowl to backyard pool. The liquid spectrum is clay slip to phone screen protector. All of the springs have water runoff, on which live bacterial mats that can take on colors like hot dog mustard, old car rust, gender confirming blue, and classic brown. The bits of old runoff which aren\'t actively wet are porcelain white; deposits of sodium carbonate the water had absorbed from the limestone below. I learn that Yellowstone National Park exists as the latex skin of a forty-mile diameter magma balloon which is being continuously filled. One day the balloon will pop and make the Earth unrecognizable for tens of thousands of years. Until then it will heat the water table and give life to the geysers, hot springs, and mud pots. I spot some people with cameras crowding together, usually a good sign. I walk over and see a big elk bull and a few elk cows. The bull looks horny and not pleased about the spectators. He looks at us, opens his mouth, and makes a loud scream akin to a child who is first learning to play a trumpet. We don\'t stick around much longer. Back to the campsite where our neighbor, Anthony, has a fire going. We make a peace offering of beer and join around the glow while we chat about Tucson and eat cold pizza. It is so cold out that we don\'t even consider sleeping in the already setup tent. I grab the blanket and bags from it and we settle into the back of the Jeep.<br><br>First stop is Old Faithful. We, very fortunately, get there only about twenty minutes before the next eruption is due to begin. We join the very large crowd and, before long, see it do its thing. It was the most viewed and least beautiful sight we\'d see in the entire trip. Next to Grand Prismatic Spring, which is definitely one of the coolest sights of the trip. The microbial mats are so strongly colored, that the steam rising from the water takes on a rainbow spectrum. After failing to get signal for a while in Madison, we head to Canyon Village to check out the waterfalls and \\"Yellowstone Grand Canyon\\". The upper and lower falls are both stunning and the canyon is a feast for the senses I could easily spend hours taking in. Unfortunately, we didn\'t have that long. Our goal was to reach Hayden Valley, a vast grassy meadow, which we heard is perfect for wildlife viewing. A few minutes into the plains and we spot elk in the distance as well as bison, lots of bison. We park above a river and watch a few dozen bovines feed, drink, swim, and nap. The entire valley is steeped in tones of gold, straw, and amber. I am zoomed in at 300mm, taking in the gorgeous beasts and absorbed in the light and color. Time slows down a while. Slower than I expected, the light eventually fades and the even chill quickly kicks in. We drive to the nearest town, Gardiner, where we eat mediocre pizza and find a spot off the side of a road to park.<br><br>Up at six, which I will later find out wasn\'t early enough to see a pack of wolves chase a grizzly bear across the plains of Lamar Valley. We do arrive just after that though and are able to catch, very far off, a few wolves playing a game of bite the bison. Further down the road about thirty bison are not only right next to the road, but are crossing it regularly, ever in search of the finest blade of grass to ruminate on. It makes for a perfect glamour shots session. We drive next to Mammoth Hot Springs where we chat with a few very friendly and knowledgeable rangers on topics like ranger uniform history, the evolution of forest fire management, and the idiosyncrasies of elk behavior. We first walk, then drive through Mammoth Hot Springs, which are unique in that the calcium carbonate deposits form stunning stepped travertine terraces. The thousand-year in the making sculptures look as though they were taken from the depths of cave. The bone white crust surrounding the active thermal areas adds to the eerie otherworldliness of the place. The day is still young and we are mentally finished with parking so we decide to drive to Spokane. Seven or so hours later we pickup two more duck banh mi, check into our hotel by the airport, and dream of things much bigger, and older, than ourselves.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"44.648575, -110.458950","From":"Sep 9, 2020","To":"Sep 11, 2020","People":"","Locations":"Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park","NumberInTrip":4,"One":"47.657073, -117.423957","Two":"48.687073, -113.741580","Three":"43.761419, -110.732252","Four":"44.648575, -110.458950","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9"},{"City":"Grand Teton National Park","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":243,"Photo":"x","Description":"After a two-hour drive we\'re in Jackson, Wyoming. To a nice cafe for a delicious egg salad on toast and a five-mushroom latte. We drive to the southern tip of Jenny Lake. The Tetons are majestic: jagged and jutting suddenly upward from the flat valley due to one tectonic plate crashing with and slipping under another. There are a few small glaciers on the mountains, but they are melting fast and will be gone in a decade or so. We take a ferry and hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. It seems it snowed heavily last night and now big hunks of snow are falling from the tall pines. Early on I get smacked in the head by a big white dump. The hike is nice, but the ground is cold and wet, which my sock/sandal combo doesn\'t love. From above, Liz spots an entrancing vortex pattern in the intersecting ferry wakes. By the end of the hike the snow is melting to the point that it looks like it\'s raining from the trees. The sky is cloudless and blue. It\'s surreal. Back to Jackson where we order two large pizzas. We park in a camp spot that is already reserved. They pull in while we are brushing our teeth and aren\'t pleased. We find a new, unreserved spot and get real cold.<br><br>Apparently moose are quite plentiful in this area. I keep looking for them.

We visit the most-photographed barn in the world and take pictures of the barn next to it. Further north to Coulter Bay where we hike around a nice peninsula that wants to be an island. At the General Store we eat very good huckleberry ice cream.

To Kalispell for gas & groceries and then Blankenship Bridge where we camp along the river bank.<br><br>Up at 4:30. At 6 Logan Pass is already filling up. We catch some more sleep and get up around 7:30 to start hiking. Our plan was to do the Highline Trail, but a friendly ranger offers some better advice. First we do the Hidden Lake hike, a three-mile hike to a...hidden lake. On our hike Liz points out the moon. I say, \\"Oh, hi!\\" and point to it, but a woman in the path thinks I\'m pointing at her. I tell her sorry, I was just saying hi to the moon. The lake is closed because of bear activity, but it is a nice view. There is a goat a few feet from me. At one point I think he might charge, but he puts his head down and continues chomping. We sit on a rock and eat peanut butter. Some ground squirrels are very interested in us. Later, a ranger will tell us her name for them, Little Cannibals. Apparently, when one gets hit by a car, others go out to eat it, and then also get hit by cars, resulting in a squirrel pile up. A Hoary Marmot poses for us for a good while. We relax in the car for a bit before we begin the Highline trail. The whole trail is 16 miles, so we opt to only do about a mile in and out. There are some narrow cliff sections, which are pretty scary. The view is incredible. There are something like three dozen glaciers in the park. All are a fraction of the size they were a few decades ago. They will likely all melt in my lifetime. What we think might be a pika says hi. We drive to the end of Going to the Sun Road, then back. To Josephine\'s for a bison gyro and fried chicken. Back to camp along the river where we chat with our neighbors and drink wine. The Milky Way hangs above.<br><br>The night was beautiful and just a bit cool, but at 7am the winds pick up and a serious cold front visits the region. Our next four days will be much colder than we packed for. We had booked a rafting trip, but when we get to the office they inform us it has been cancelled due to the wind. Our next stop is the Montana Mystery House & Vortex, which seemed like a quirky art installation on Atlas Obscura. However, in speaking to the desk attendant and seeing the gift shop it feels a lot more like a scheme designed to prey on the naive. Speaking of schemes designed to prey on the naive, just down the road from the Mystery House is a trailer semi-encircled by about 15 billboards, featuring the Ten Commandments, and statements about Jesus\' ability to save my soul. I stop. Inside is a gift shop selling very large t-shirts, embroidered face masks, and car magnets; all detailing either the Ten Commandments or the healing properties of Jesus. I ask about the masks. The attendant tells me about the pastor in Oregon who believes we don\'t need masks (because god will heal us), but whom was instructed by God to make them to help financially support the church. He mentioned something about a divine discovery of an embroidery machine. I leave, but not before he tells me about how his Columbia shoes were very durable on his mission in Indonesia. Gyro & falafel in Missoula. In Idaho Falls we get a hotel, go to Walmart to buy long-sleeved shirts, and begin watching I\'m Thinking of Ending Things.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"48.687073, -113.741580","From":"Sep 5, 2020","To":"Sep 7, 2020","People":"","Locations":"Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park","NumberInTrip":2,"One":"47.657073, -117.423957","Two":"48.687073, -113.741580","Three":"43.761419, -110.732252","Four":"44.648575, -110.458950","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9"},{"City":"Spokane","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":241,"Photo":"x","Description":"We are given a Jeep, which is very nice to drive.

I am aware of how many homeless-looking people there are. We drive south through a cute neighborhood. Some of the quirky homes remind me how conservative Dallas is. We get water, beer, hard kombucha, and chips from a grocery store. Down the road is Manito Park, where we get out and eat a watery Massaman curry next to a small lake. We walk and find a French garden full of flowers and bees being bees. Back downtown, we stop into two vintage shops. I am tempted by scratched Paul Simon vinyl and a porch swing made from the bench of an old Ferris wheel. We check into the Historic Davenport and check out for a bit. The sun is now low in the sky. We pop out and walk to Riverfront Park where we feed the Garbage Goat, sit beneath the big top, and view the falls. We get a very good duck banh mi from Wild Sage and eat it in the room. For the second half of dinner we get a salad and Gorgonzola fries from Downriver Grill and also eat that in the room. We stop by the milk bottle, but it is not lit up.<br><br>We get free breakfast with our room so we head down. I order the crab omelette, which is okay and Liz has a salmon benedict.

We walk by the lake and then drive east.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"47.657073, -117.423957","From":"Sep 4, 2020","To":"Sep 5, 2020","People":"","Locations":"Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park","NumberInTrip":1,"One":"47.657073, -117.423957","Two":"48.687073, -113.741580","Three":"43.761419, -110.732252","Four":"44.648575, -110.458950","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9"},{"City":"Albuquerque","Trip":"Hot Air","Id":240,"Photo":"x","Description":"After work on Friday, Sean, Ash, Liz and I drive up north and share a cheap motel for the night.<br><br>We drive for most of the day, but stop in a small town to eat and buy chambray shirts.

Liz gets a creamy uni udon and I get one with curry and fried chicken. Both are very good. The servers are Chinese. Someone asks for a box for their leftover udon and they give them one. We are definitely in America. We walk to the Time Out Market where we watch video of ballet dancers playing on an old train station time table. We are stuffed, but there is an orange cardamom poppy donut I want, so we get that and a coffee. We go to Back Bay to shop, but don\'t like anything. We walk east through the first public in America. It is pretty dead, but there are some cute chubby squirrels building nests. We walk for a bit longer and then get a ride to the hotel and nap. Kelly and Chris come by and we catch up for a few before heading to dinner at Forage. We have some yummy cocktails plus root charcuterie, a cheese plate, sunchokes with cacao & tarragon emulsion, house pimento marscapone, roasted carrots, and veg ferments.

It is very entertaining. I take the train to the hotel and find Liz waiting for me in bed. We cuddle for a few and she heads to work. I sleep. After some failed internet login I opt to meditate and work out. I told myself I wouldn\'t drink caffeine on this trip. I\'m already feeling it. I decide to check out a nearby art gallery...which it turns out I\'ve already been to. The art, however, is all different and even better than last time. My favorite piece is a very large balloon that is on a loop of being inflated and deflated. At its peak, it pushes up against both walls and the ceiling. I also am quite fond of the pile of rubble, which is breathing. I get some fake meat and potato chips from a Chinese convenience store. I snack, dress, and walk. Liz meets me and we have a lovely dinner at sixpenny including kangaroo tartare, grouper with celeriac sauce and champagne foam, lovely beef, and Mead custard. Train and walk to Scout for some weird yummy drinks.<br><br>I sleep until 1. Liz gave me her drink voucher, so I head down to the bar where I have an XPA and chat with Joseph, the bartender, for a good while. I walk to Lankan Filling station and meet Liz for delicious Sri Lankan curries and hoppers. Then we get a ride to the Opera House and see the Marriage of Figaro, which is excellent and hard to follow, both in plot and music. We walk to Maybe Sammy for fancy drinks. We walk next to Employees Only, but don\'t like the basic drink club vibe, so we opt to go to bed. <br><br>Up early for our flight to Adelaide. Liz sleeps and I watch Parasite. We take a bus downtown. The town is a bit run down and there are many down and out folks hanging around. It is also charming with beautiful architecture and many cool looking shops. We stop by Lord of the Fries for poutine. We wander the high street for a good bit and I save Liz from sitting on bird poop. We walk down to Central Market and pick up cheese, terrine, kiwi, jam and tomatoes right before they close. We head back north and come upon a big square where we lie on the grass and sun ourselves for a good while. Hungry Jack\'s (Burger King) sells a vegan Rebel Whopper, son we try one and it is delicious. Next we head towards the Botanic Gardens where we take in the beautiful plants and birds for a good bit before heading to the airport to pick up our bags and a car. A good long drive. I see a kangaroo bounce across the road. We get to Cape Jervis, where we stay in a room for the night. There are many millipedes outside. We snack on a loaf of bread the folks at Sixpenny gave us, soft and hard cheese, fig jam, and terrine.<br><br>Up early and to the ferry over to Kangaroo Island where we get a rental car and drive west. We are on the lookout for roos immediately. We see about 4, but they are all roadkill so far. We get to Frogs & Roses, which is a lovely restaurant, nursery, and home. We say hi to Morris, the donkey, as well as some chickens, and a bulldog. After a mediocre lime milkshake and a sage & rosemary pizza, we head on. We go to Flinders Chase, a large park at the western tip of the island. A silly ranger informs me that roos sleep during the day so gave us some things to do for a few hours before coming back to the roo zone. Onward to the century-old lighthouse and the fur seal hangout spot, Admiral\'s Arch. We see some fight and are able to get quite close. They smell like the zoo. We finish our picnic food and head to Remarkable Rock, which is an apt description. It looks like something Gaudi designed. We return to the visitor\'s center where we begin our walk. Immediately we see an echidna snuffling along. We follow him a while and, although we are right next to him, he appears to be completely unaware of us. We walk on and see many fluffy balls in the trees, which are sleepy koalas. They are all over. The we see three kangaroos feeding. Then two more. Then five off in the distance. We walk into a clearing and they are all over. Some are lying down, some are feeding, some are hopping around. The sun is low, there are geese around, and everything is beautiful. We are in a miniature world of animals and I can hardly believe it. We stroll through this for a good while and then head back to the car. When we\'re almost there I realize my keys are not in my pocket. After ensuring they are not on me I realize for certain that I dropped them somewhere on our 1.5km forest walk. Fuck. The sun is low in the sky. I take of my coat and start running. I explore the echidna area; nothing. I run for about ten minutes, scanning the forest floor as quickly as I can. Fuck. Just keep looking. There they are! In a spot where I stopped to shoot a roo for a few. I am so relieved. Liz and I reunite, she laughs, all is good. We drive back through the gorgeous fading sky and see many hoppers on and along the road. Into Kingscote where we eat eggplant Parmesan and drink wine at the one restaurant that is still open. To our cute hotel just down the road for a tuck in. <br><br>To the ferry and across. Our driver is lovely and teaches us about some of the local cockatoo varieties. She also recommends a nice lunch spot and winery on our way out of town called Penny\'s Hill. We head up there, taste some very nice wines, and eat Mediterranean dips, yummy potatoes, and a kimchi toastie. We pick up a few bottles and head to the Cube. There are many modern Victorian style nickel machines. The art on the ground floor is somewhat charming, with a Meow Wolf story-like quality, but mostly feels about 15 years out of date. The Dali stuff is pretty cool, but his paintings are definitely better. Wine tasting is included with our entrance so we do that and really enjoy the sav blanc and the dessert sav blanc, so we get those. Barossa Valley is two hours away so we start driving. For some reason maps has us go through a bunch of farms and some unpaved road, but it is absolutely gorgeous. We arrive at the B&B, nap, then chat with our host for a few before going out for \\"The Best Pizza in Australia\\". The place did not seem promising, however the pizzas, loaded with local German-style meats, were delicious. <br><br>Sophia made us a breakfast of fried eggs and rashers. We then proceeded to do some computer stuff and sip port for the next few hours. Over to Maggie Beer\'s farm for a cheese plate and some sav blanc. We attempt another place, but it turns out it\'s just a processing facility. We drive through many palm trees and then head to Two Hands, where we do a tasting of some strong German Shirazes. Relax for a bit. I teach Peter, Sophie\'s son, The Hall of the Mountain King on piano and then to Musque for dinner. We are too late to do the tasting menu so we order scallops, smoked salmon, smoked tomatoes caprese, buttermilk salad, fries, and a Tasmanian g&t. <br><br>Another breakfast and we\'re off. I drove for 8 hours to get us to Warrnambool, a cute town and the western tip of the Great Ocean Road. We relax for a few in the motel, then head out for Thai. We get the same thing we always get, which is Massaman Curry and Pad See Ewe. Both are delicious. We walk to the theater and watch Joker, which left us both feeling a bit let down and even a tad angry. To the hotel where we talk film theory and finish a bottle of white. <br><br>It is raining. It will all day. We hang out in Bright Bird for a few hours, drink some lovely coffee, eat a delicious shakshuka & potato hash with cauliflower puree, and do some work. To Target where Liz gets a hoodie. Drive to Childer\'s Cove, which is gorgeous, but very wet and windy. Next we head to cheese world where we get some yummy cheese and find a nice marble cheese plate. Down the GORD to London Bridge, Loch Ard Gorge, and the Twelve (seven left) Apostles. We wrap up the night in Apollo Bay at the GORD Brewhouse, where we have some beers, a nice meal of nachos & fish \'n chips, and sleep upstairs.<br><br>Our day is spent completing the GORD. First we do a waterfall hike. We snack on some jalapeno & honey cheddar. Up a steep hill for a Teddy\'s Lookout over the town and bay. We work our way up and stop by Anglesea Golf Club to do a kangaroo tour. Ian drives us through the ground of the course as we get to see scores of roo\'d boys and girls hanging out on the greens. We grab another Rebel Whopper before heading into Melbourne, dropping off the car, and having some Shiraz in the hotel. A nice older man who knows a lot about Australian water infrastructure drives us to Naked for Satan, where we discovere the kitchen is closed. We walk and discover that next door is a Mexican restaurant and bar called Little Hop, which smells delicious. Five tacos, two quesadillas, four gorditas, a beer, and a sangria later we can verify that it is, in fact, very delicious. We walk over to Above Board, a super minimalist cocktail bar with lovely bartenders and excellent drinks. <br><br>Our first stop for the day is Lune, a pastry shop recently voted the best croissant is Melbourne. We have a caccio e pepe circle, a ham & cheese croissant, and a lemon curd cruffin. They are indeed superlative. We will return tomorrow. To Dangerfield where Liz finds a cute dress and earrings with eyeballs in them. To UNIQLO for socks. We take a but to Three Bags Full where we have very nice coffees, Liz gets a potato hash with beef cheek, and I order a chorizo shakshuka. We head to the hotel to relax for a bit. We finish the red from last night and walk to Gingerboy for tartare w/creme fraiche, various very good dumplings, Korean chicken wings, and cocktails. We head back to the hotel and watch The Last Jedi.<br><br>Back to Lune for a plain croissant, a ham & cheese croissant, a pan au chocolate, an almond croissant and great coffee. We walk to Holy Moly and play 27 holes of fun, wacky, spooky mini golf, and get free visors. Next we walk to Heartbreaker to fucking good, greasy pizza and weird beer: barrel aged g&t ale and a habanero & rosewater corn lager. From there we head to the airport and fly to Sydney. I meet Liz, Gabriel, and Manav in the lounge for a few, then we head to Cho-Cho San to meet Michael and Mark for a nice Japanese dinner with cocktails and an unenthused waitor lady. It is immediately awesome to see them again and it feels like everyone is having a great time. The place is shutting down, as is the whole neighborhood, so we get a cab to a nearby Texan style salloon for beer and Pina Coladas. We are all feeling tired and everyone but me has an early morning, so we hug and part ways.<br><br>I wake up, iron Liz\'s dress, going her for a quick bite, and see her off. I proceed to clean up, fiddle on the computer, and eventually head to Cross Eatery for a burnt cauliflower with kimchi toastie and a Wattle seed cola.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-34.501490, 138.983492","From":"Oct 30, 2019","To":"Nov 12, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Adelaide, Kangaroo Island, Barossa Valley, Great Ocean Road, Melbourne, Sydney","NumberInTrip":"","One":"-33.856782, 151.215303","Two":"-34.916926, 138.608874","Three":"-36.047669, 136.756198","Four":"-35.246295, 138.550847","Five":"-34.501463, 138.983502","Six":"-38.385122, 142.490493","Seven":"-38.758727, 143.670283","Eight":"-37.815414, 144.954807","Nine":"-33.869516, 151.225307","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6"},{"City":"Izumo","Trip":"Birthplace","Id":237,"Photo":"x","Description":"At the airport McDonald\'s, I accidentally order only one hash brown and get very angry. I realize how dumb I am being and stop. We fly on a plane and ride on two buses. Then we are at Izumo-Taisha, which is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. Liz informs me that the Japanese word for October translates roughly to \'without gods\'. It is called that because in October all of the Shinto gods in Japan leave their shrines and come to Izumo-Taisha to hang out. Liz finds a beautiful little frog. Then she finds a praying mantis on the main shrine gate. Then she finds a beautiful beetle on a sign post. Were these creatures the gods in earthly forms? Yes. Now we walk in the sun and arrive at Tanakaya, a quaint restaurant which serves homemade soba in the Izumo style. They process the buckwheat with the hull included, this making the noodles darker, coarser, and earthier. The noodles are served on three trays, each with a different topping (foam, daikon, egg). Our server brings us a pot of pasta water, serves us a cup, and pours a splash of dashi in it. We get on a bus and ride through the windy mountains to the edge of the peninsula. There is another nice old shrine there so we get out and explore it. Older people here talk to us as though we speak the language. It is quite charming. We start walking towards the ocean, but Liz sees a cat, then two more, then two more. She approaches slowly. They are sunning and cleaning; they don\'t run off. We spend the next half hour sitting in the street playing with some sweet babes. The cheeky boy is especially fond of Liz. He climbs into her lap, she cradles him, and they fall in love. We walk up the mountain. Small shops are selling beautiful sea shells and blowfish with googly-eyes attached. I very nearly step on a praying mantis. We get to the lighthouse. It is white brick against a white sky. We walk along a cliff and lean out over rough, foamy, emerald ocean. We bus back to town. Liz has a headache and sleeps. I work on my resume. Two hours later we get up and head to Taste, a Brooklyn inspired restaurant. The tiny room is full, but the owner comes out and constructs a table out of saw horses for us in the parking lot. Craft beer, potato salad, fried olives, mushroom and duck salad, tuna tartar. Liz drops a piece of tuna on the ground. I consciously turn around for a few seconds. It is gone. I\'m still hungry so we get chicken wings. Liz is messaging with Kyle, who informs her that he and his friend were just nearly victims of a hate crime stabbing. He is fine, but we are shaken. Walking home, we stop into a conbini and get ice cream. Liz\'s is rich milk. Mine is sweet potato and comes in a cardboard-like cone, which quite closely resembles the look and feel of a sweet potato.<br><br>We sleep until 9:50. Checkout is at 10:00. I shave in the lobby bathroom. We walk down the canal. An old man looks at us, tells us something, and flaps his arms behind his back. He points behind a low bridge. Below the bridge is a large, white crane. It is feeding on small fish and is majestic in the shade. Into a cafe next door. The wood is dark from years of wear, the furniture is post-war. There are huge potted plants in concrete. Liz says it smells like her grandparents\' house when Hans was alive. We eat gratin, fish, and chicken. I nearly fall asleep at the table. We had intended to go to a nearby onsen town, but the bus ride costly, so we opt to go bowling instead. The building looks nearly abandoned. There are only squat toilets. The lanes are very oily and on my first throw I slip and bang my knee on the wood. I focus on my form and center of gravity. Liz and I tie the first game at 109. We both beat our scores in the second game with Liz at 120 and me at 137, which is likely my personal best. I rent ping pong paddles and look for Liz. I find her at a slot machine in the kids arcade. She wins two of three games. I eat a not-good melon pan at the airport and I fly home. Liz doesn\'t make the first flight, so she watches The Handmaid\'s Tale for three hours at the airport.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"35.433922, 132.628204","From":"Oct 5, 2019","To":"Oct 6, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Izumo","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/qGxbWhofwwo7hR9v6"},{"City":"Kyoto","Trip":"Final Round","Id":236,"Photo":"x","Description":"We have sushi from a plastic tray in the airport. We land outside of Osaka and take the monorail to the Expo \'70 Park. We have tickets to see the newly reopened interior of the Tower of the Sun. The inside features a zig-zagging staircase, which works its way up around the Tree of Life, which is more like and upturned root upon which are mounted animatronic (not operating, unfortunately) plaster creatures. From low to high they are meant to represent the progress of evolution of life on Earth. The gorilla\'s head is missing, leaving behind only hydraulic pumps and metal jaws. We take two trains and a bus to Ryoanji temple. It is very cool, green, and mossy. We take off our shoes and walk on soft, old wood. There is a rock feature where six large rocks are surrounded by a pond of beautifully raked pebbles. We wander the complex and find a seven-legged spider constructing a scribbly web. We get a sparkling apple and jelly drink and get on a very crowded bus heading for the center of town. We go by Kichi Kichi Omurice, not expecting to get in, but are let in. We order the classic Omurice and a beef stew. The man with purple hair puts on a fun show of making the rice. It is all yummy and we eat it very quickly. We take a bus to a food hall, where we find The Roots of All Evil - Little Evil: celery gin, black Sambuca, plum wine. Ghost Note: gin, absinthe, bonito, matcha, grapefruit, honey. Liz sees the bartender drink from the mixing spoon multiple times. We have a mediocre donut and bus back north. We head to nokishika711 gin and cocktail labo for: Fungus Negroni: Shitake gin, amaro, sake, shoyu, umami bitters, fermented mushroom; The Roots: gin (burdock, cardamom, coriander, cinnamon), fermented burdock bitters, ginger ale, rosemary, ginger shoot, cucumber. The drinks are great. We walk back through the touristy area. A young guy is covering Tears in Heaven. Not far a way is a man in an fold-open van wearing a duck hat, singing with a duck toy in his mouth, and entertaining a good crowd. His van says He is Starduck Tony.<br><br>We check our of hotel #1. We walk to Koe donuts for a wasanbon and a pistachio cake donut. We continue to a nice little shop for cold brew. Northward to Aoonigiri for salmon & salmon roe, curry chicken, miso & negi, and tofu & bonito onigiri sets. The owner has a monk-like quality and the restaurant feels sacred and hushed. Next we get on a cute train, with outward facing seats, up to the mountains. We arrive at Kurama, a Tengu-inspired mountain shrine hike. We hike up in gorgeous cool weather. We hike down in the rain. We learn that Liz\'s rain jacket isn\'t actually all that water resistant. We get back to the hotel and change into what warm clothes we have. After a while we get up and walk to Cocina Órale for margaritas, chips & salsa, nachos and delicious tacos. We walk just a couple of minutes and return to nokishika711 for Soil & Pimp Sessions: burdock gin, black soybean bitters, whisky, tonic, herbs, soil. Silly Symphony: porcini gin, chestnut, yogurt, soda, fermented mushroom, honey, egg white, chocolate. Fly Me to the Moon: spice gin, Suze, sake, ginseng bitters, moon candy, pumpkin flake.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"35.116725, 135.766938","From":"Sep 21, 2019","To":"Sep 22, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Kyoto","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/6tn69bRT6FWG4WQT6"},{"City":"Da Nang","Trip":"Southern Vietnam","Id":235,"Photo":"x","Description":"At 9:30 we get a call from the from desk to remind us that breakfast is closing soon. We eat. It is surprisingly good. I meditate for the first time in a few days. I fantasize about sex as a distraction from the discomfort of stillness. Our driver from last night takes us to My Son. Back-lit cattails beard rust brick rubble piles. This is a nursing home for retired buildings. Moss liver spots. The beings lean to one side. Many require support to sit upright. Some show obvious cosmetic work. All are thinning on top. Tufts of shrubbery grow from strange new nooks. They are very old. They exist now only to remind us of how life used to be. I am briefly tempted to kick one. It is cloudy, we are sweaty. There are loud, unfamiliar insects. I can hear gongs and drums in the distance. When I get to where I think the sound originated, there is nothing there. We hydrate and leave. We are dropped right into Hoi An Old Town. The sun is setting and there are hundreds of cloth lanterns out. We hit the food stalls. Banana pancake with Nutella. Vietnamese pizza, unsure what it was exactly. Sticky rice banana. We sit at a street-side cafe and have beers. A young girl tries to sell us lanterns, two times. She is very adorable and Liz decides to give her a couple of dollars. She hugs Liz and kisses her on the cheek. Liz looks ready to cry. We are very sticky and decide to have a Banh Mi and call it a night.<br><br>At breakfast a kind woman makes me a very strong coffee and gives another man the waffle I made. We take the shuttle to Old Town. The sky is old dishwasher and it\'s being wrung out over the whole of the region today. We find a Banh My stand with a long line and get it. They put at three different sauce spreads and four different types of meat on this. The bread is very french and newborn. It is the best thing we\'ve eaten in Vietnam. There are so many flavors at once and interesting changes from bite to bite. I can\'t comprehend it, but I love it. We walk through miniature lakes and rivers. We wade upstream and find a spa. We get decent foot massages. My hairy legs need about 300% more oil than Liz\'s. I meditate in the car on the way to Da Nang. Get to the hotel and relaxed. We look for the hot tub, but there isn\'t one. It\'s still quite rainy out and we are feeling a recuperative type of night so we touch good and get Indian. The lamb korma is the best I\'ve ever tasted and the chicken Tikka Masala is unique and delicious.<br><br>We finish the delicious curry cold then top it off with a mediocre hotel buffet. Hai picks us up and drives us to Ba Na Hills, a Vietnam Disneyland. He plays techno at a soft volume. We ride a very long cable car and arrive. We spend the next few hours exploring Medieval Square, Buddhism World, Big Hands Bridge, and Jules Verne Arcade. I am slightly disappointed at the absence of a Communism Cafe or Viet-Cong Village. We ride a two-person roller coaster. We eat Vietnamese doughnut balls, a sausage on a stick, and a strawberry smoothie. We wander a lot and head to the arcade. We play a Crusin\' USA type game and basketball game, which Liz does exceptionally well at. Back to the hotel for a nap. We wake and get a ride to Hải Sản Đà Nẵng Nhà hàng Bé Mặn, a point-to-your-dinner seafood hall, which appears to be quite popular with the locals. We get eight chili garlic shrimp, two big blue langoustines, ten green sauce oysters, Morning Glory, fried rice, and some beers. Afterward, we walk down the beach. There are many little crabs running around. I manage to chase one who runs sideways with his pincers up. We come back and watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.<br><br>Breakfast and face masks, so-so massages, more superlative Indian, and then we head to the airport. We fly there to HCMC, but on the flight Liz starts feeling unwell. We land and she goes to the bathroom for a while. She has diarrhea, is vomiting and is having intense stomach pains, which increase in severity. She lies on a bench in the Departure terminal. We decide not to to fly to Tokyo tonight. We decide to get a cab and a hotel, but she can\'t even stand up to walk to the car pickup. Eventually she is able to walk and we decide to go to the hospital. We get a ride and go in the local hospital first. It is pretty depressing and no one speaks English. I try filling out a form in Vietnamese. A man wearing only pants runs out yelling in pain. I see hospital beds with blood stains on them. One of the staff manages to tell me that the international clinic is actually the next building over. We go there and it is a much nicer experience immediately. A doctor very quickly diagnoses Liz as having food poisoning and prescribes her some pain and nausea medication. She comes out to the lobby where I am waiting with our bags, but he quickly calls her back again. I wait for about 40 minutes. I hear the occasional yelp of pain. She is the only person in there and I begin to worry. I eventually inquire as to what is happening. Apparently they gave Liz a cot to lie on. I find her sleeping there, but still in a lot of pain. Soon she gets up and we get a ride to a cheap airport hotel.<br><br>I walk to get water, Pocari Sweat, and McDonald\'s. She seems to be feeling considerably better and eats all of her food. She sleeps more and I meditate and look for jobs. We watch The King of Comedy and Shock Treatment, which make for a pretty fun double feature. On the plane I watch Inside Out and cry deeply.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"16.056932, 108.246375","From":"Aug 28, 2019","To":"Sep 2, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang","NumberInTrip":"","One":"15.878503, 108.331998","Two":"16.056932, 108.246375","Three":"15.996980, 107.989971","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6"},{"City":"Ho Chi Min City","Trip":"Southern Vietnam","Id":234,"Photo":"x","Description":"Getting here seemed unnecessarily stressful.

I grab a bitter, unsweetened coffee and spicy nori from 7/11. We chat a bit, talk with Sean, and go for a walk. It is pouring, but completely dies off in less than two minutes. Our first stop is Tung I\'m Hungry for Pho Kho Ga. The noodles are dry. The woman who served them pours many condiments on top and mixes them all together. It is sweet, spicy, peanuty, and herbaceous. There is also a meat-stock soup. We talk about The Spell of the Sensuous, a few other books, and single-celled organisms. We walk again for a while. We arrive at Workshop, a Third Wave shop, and have a local espresso latte. It\'s complex and reminds me of going down on a woman. V60, passion fruit cheesecake, and pumpkin roll round it off. Young cats hang out on a motorcycle. We slowly wander back. I mediate and Cori stretches. Liz arrives. We all catch up and eat English chocolate. We get a ride to Hum, which is a vegetarian restaurant owned by the same people who run Uu Dam Chay in Hanoi. We eat loads of delicious veggies, pecan fried rice, panang tofu pucks, young banana, and doughnut balls. We wander the streets looking for either a massage or a bar. We eventually settle on Below Whisky Den. There is a group of 8 people clapping loudly and in poor sync with TLC\'s Waterfalls. We order and drink some very good stuff. Mine is whiskey forward and delicious. Liz\'s tastes like Cold Stone Cake Batter™ ice cream. A guy from the Bronx plays a set of covers ranging from Johnny Cash for Jeff Buckley. He sounds good and blesses us. We are very tired.<br><br>Liz has a headache. Cori is working. I read some Douglas Adams and eat nori. I go for a walk, wander through a local market. The colors, lighting, angles, smells, and sounds overwhelm me. Raw meat is being chopped on a counter. A woman is gutting a fish. Shrimp in a bowl of water. A big rat scurrying in the dim light. Stacks of packages I can not understand. I buy coconut, which a master drains and de-meats into a bag in seconds. It starts to rain. It starts to pour. I stand in the shop and listen to it. Back. Liz is up and feeling slightly better. We eat coconut. The three of us head back out to the market. I see a woman cooking something that looks like a bright green pancake. We get one, it is coconut and pandan and delicious. We also get a fried plantain and some other fried ball. We walk through the market and see many beautiful vegetables and fruits. Shrimp are jumping out of baskets. Eggs coated in charcoal. Chicken feet. A pigs head. A cage packed full of chickens. Frogs tied together with plastic. We head to a stall and get a noodle soup with tomato, fish cake, snails, and a blood brick. The broth is pleasant. It was Bun Rieu. We find another fried plantain stand and have that. There is some fun workout equipment and we play on that for a bit. We walk to Workshop for more coffee and passion fruit cheesecake. Now to get feet massages, which is nice nice. We go by two different kitchenware stores and find some salt dishes and chopsticks. Liz found a place that looks promising called Racha, so we head there for dinner. We order some great cocktails. For food we get: charcoal tempura calamari, beef mint salad, fried silken tofu, duck shiitake dumplings, wagyu gyoza, crab lemongrass wontons, spare ribs, and beef tongue with rice crackers. It is all very yummy. Back at home we play Name That Crease™ with Sean.<br><br>I wake up. It\'s 10:30. Liz had a headache in the night, but is feeling better now. I make a coffee and we snack on nori. Cori comes back from a workout and I improvise a song and dance for her return. We take our time and eventually head out. We get a delicious banana coconut drink. The massage place is full, but we make an appointment. Walk to My Banh Mi for chicken lemongrass with spicy garlic, and coconut pork with black pepper cream, plus a side of spring roll. A man, who we later presume is the owner, tells us about the origin of mole, Caesar salad and chimichangas. We look briefly and the Notre Dame and get a ride to the War Remnants Museum, which focuses on the destruction of the US in the war. We certainly caused a lot of it. We rush over to get very good massages from two very strong ladies. Back to the apartment where we swim with Cori, talk about gender, and head to Bed Nha Luv Tinh, a restaurant that Cori had recommended. Tofu with seafood, catfish in clay pot, beef with salt, duck skewer with sugar sticky rice, banana cake with coconut cream. We stay up late and talk about books, gender, and melatonin.<br><br>Goodbye to Cori and onto a bus for a tour. We ride with Nam, our guide, and ten other Europeans. There are many other tour groups, each is separated by culture. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Western. We get to the Cu-Chi tunnel area. We learn about tunnel building, strategy, and booby traps. People try getting into a small hole. We are taken to a shooting range where you can try firing an M-16 into a dirt hill. Many do. The climax of the tour is getting the chance to crawl through 100 meters of genuine Viet-Cong tunnel. I do. Lots of driving and then we are in Mekong. We have a big, many coursed lunch, which is better than I expected it to be. Now to a boat. The river is brown. This is right where the tiger scene happened in Apocalypse Now. It is very cloudy but there is no rain. We are turned away from a fishing village. We continue on the river and head towards a coconut candy factory where we taste and buy that. We ride a tuk-tuk through narrow concrete streets until we arrive at a performance area where a local group sings traditional Vietnamese songs and If You\'re Happy. I dip a piece of fruit into sugar and take a bite. It isn\'t sugar, it is salt. Liz was watching me and is cracking up now. Nam brings out a python and we hold it. On a small boat down where an old woman paddles us down a narrow Creek for a few minutes. Once we\'re out they fire up the engines and zip away. I chat with a Dutch father on the long ride back to town. At the airport. I gorge in the lounge. We arrive to Da Nang and a nice driver takes us to our hotel in Hoi An.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"10.776029, 106.705160","From":"Aug 24, 2019","To":"Aug 27, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang","NumberInTrip":"","One":"10.776029, 106.705160","Two":"10.969431, 106.497128","Three":"10.344805, 106.364799","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6"},{"City":"Sydney","Trip":"Once in a Lifetime","Id":233,"Photo":"x","Description":"I wake up to a beautiful view of Hyde Park and St. Mary\'s Cathedral. To the posh art deco lounge for a nice breakfast where I have a mishap with a tight french press plunger and spray hot, pulpy coffee over the table and Liz. She is very cool about it. Sydney is chilly and I didn\'t bring any warm stuff. We do some shopping in Uniqlo and then take a bus south to White Rabbit to see Hot Blood, a collection of interesting and disturbing art from China and Taiwan. We drink some overpriced blue milk from Two Sis. No luck with massages. We relax in the hotel for a bit. I meditate then we head up to the bar and get Aperol spritzes and snacks. From there we walk to Since I Left You where we order Little Grace: Zubrowka vodka, apple, elderflower, spice, whites; Guilty Pleasure: cognac, Pimm\'s, cacao, bitters, spice; Chile con frijoles toasty. Next onto PS40 and for a Day of the Dead: Chartreuse, maraschino, mezcal, egg, mole; Into the Wild: macadamia washed vodka, verjus, salt baked pineapple, basil. A three-minute walk and we\'re at Uncle Ming\'s. We\'re not feeling the vibe here so we leave before ordering. Instead we make our way to Frankie\'s Pizza, which has a much better vibe. We order slices of good good pizza, drink some good beer, and listen to a local band play.<br><br>We meet Sok outside a station where. She drives us up to the Blue Mountains for a day of exploration. We check out the Three Sisters and hike around there just a bit. Into Katoomba. We attempt a seemingly Hobbit-themed restaurant, but we don\'t feel like waiting for an hour to get in so we opt for a fippy chippy. Next to Wentworth Falls for some more mini hiking, bird spotting, and fall viewing. We stop by a cute street town to wander for a few and then head back to Sydney. Sok drops us off and we make for Earls Juke Joint in New Town for some delicious local sour ales. From there we walk a few doors down to Lentils as Anything for a pay-as-you-can vegan Dahl and a coconut soup. A little further on to Jacoby\'s Tiki Bar, which is a charming Twin Peaks homage (with a Black Lodge hallway) and boasts delicious drinks.<br><br>We take our time at the hotel and I eventually get the wifi working on my laptop. To Cross Cafe for white bean & kale soup, caramelized cauliflower and kimchi toastie, miso pumpkin, and some PS40 sodas. It is very good. Liz goes back to the hotel to work and I pick up some new ear studs from a nice piercing shop. I watch some old men play giant chess in the park before coming back and meditating. We drink and snack in the hotel lounge then cuddle for a little bit before I leave to catch my flight. I get a free katsu chicken sandwich meal with my priority pass and sleep for most of the flight.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-33.713105, 150.310943","From":"Aug 2, 2019","To":"Aug 5, 2019","People":"Sok","Locations":"Fiji, Sydney","NumberInTrip":2,"One":"-17.934460, 177.260068","Two":"-33.713105, 150.310943","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oepkcQ6q48zzMSGk9"},{"City":"Fiji","Trip":"Once in a Lifetime","Id":232,"Photo":"x","Description":"We eat T\'s Tantan vegan ramen at Narita then fly to Fiji. We watch Fight Club, which we find remarkably relevant. We order a nice chicken with oyster sauce at the Nadi Airport--they missed a golden opportunity by not naming it Nadi by Nature--then get a taxi to the resort. We meet some nice humans along the way. We wait in the lobby area for a what feels like too long while they get the room ready. We attempt to play chess on a board with no pawns. We try to play pool, but there are too few balls and the nets had big holes in them. Into the room and we lie down a bit. We wake up at around 5pm and head to the pool; there are no towels so we walk around a bit. We sit in the lounge for some decent cocktails. We find a hot tub so we do that for a bit. Back to the room where we order a cheese pizza and drink a bottle of bubbles. Nice times are had by all.<br><br>Buffet breakfast. The steamed buns in cardamom coconut milk are yummy and texturally very non-Western. We play chess on a giant board where each square is as long as my foot and the queen\'s crown comes up to the ticklish part of my thigh. I beat Liz, but give her some helpful tips. We head to the pool where we swim as far as the swim-up bar. We dry off in the sun, read about the formation of stars, drink more bubbles, order a pepperoni pizza, and chat with Mom & Jim. They give us a whirlwind tour of their cruise in the North Sea, their road trip around the Midwest, and Danny\'s memorial service in Middletown, CA. We just miss the sunset. To the infinity pool and more hot tub. We get smart looking and arrive at the fish restaurant apparently too close to closing because we get glares from the kitchen staff. We receive some quite good (hopefully clean) food including coconut civiche, tuna poke, seared salmon filet, and cauliflower soup. We play another game of big chess; this time in the moonlight. I win, though not as easily as before.<br><br>Buffet again for mostly coconut stuff and fries. Someone forgot to put custard in the custard donut. We receive a wildly inflated hotel bill and have to sort that out. We relax and read a bit. Kay #2 then takes us to the airport to pick up our rental car...which they didn\'t have. In fact, they didn\'t have any cars. The sweet woman tries to sort it out and manages to find an eight passenger van for us, but by now Liz and I have decided we are done with Fiji and that we\'d rather spend the rest of our time somewhere else in the world. We book some tickets to Sydney and, after dealing with some very mediocre customer service, demonstrate exemplary hedonism in the well-stocked lounge; probably our favorite part of Fiji. We get on a flight. I exhibit inhuman restraint by not taking the penne Bolognese with shaved Parmesan or the Hagen Das single serve ice cream cup.

We\'re pretty sure she doesn\'t know they are pot leaves. We get vegan sushi and also a beef rice block at the airport then catch a bus and then a ferry to get us to Naoshima. First we check out the big red pumpkin then have some long, chewy udon. We check into our hotel and fall asleep for a few hours. We get a nice latte and miss a bus so we grab a taxi to the Honmura port and where we get tickets for Art House, a collection of empty homes in the area which have been made into art exhibits. #1 Ishibashi for waterfalls and burnt cliffs. #2 Haisha for statue of liberty and laquer room. We stop by \'The Water\' to dip our feet in a nice pool. #3 Gokaisho for flower petals on tatami. #4 Kadoya for LED numbers in water. We walk to Go\'o shrine for white rocks, an underground chamber, and ice stairs coming up from the underground pool, through the ground, and up the shrine. To the bubble bike parking lot and then on a bus to Benesse House Museum for some more nice art and looking at the sky. Our favorite piece here is a wall of phrases like \'play and die\' and \'fuck and live\' written in neon. WE get another cab and find it\'s our same drive from earlier (apparently there are only two taxis on the island). We make for Naoshima I <3 Yu public bath, but get distracted by a cute mid-century Americana diner with a great smelling grill out front so we have some Cajun chicken and a tuna melt first. Into I <3 Yu for a nice bath with a big elephant sculpture. We see Buddy from the diner and chat with him for a while. It turns out he\'s good friends with Elovis Sato! Next we walk to Bar Saru for a local rice beer and a local ginger beer, which are weird and pretty good. To our tatami room for cuddles and bed.<br><br>Nice coffees from Mikazukishoten. Our barista is very friendly and gives us some stickers. We bus to Honmura and get tickets for James Turrell\'s Minamidera, which is a very dark room where you sit still for 15 minutes and perceive your eyes adjusting to the soft \'light screen\'. It is incredible. We pop into a glass ball mini gallery. Bus down to the Chichu Museum. We wait a while and drink an olive soda, which tastes like Sour Punch rope. Into Chichu: The James Turrell pieces are profound. We do Open Field twice. Monet\'s lillies are poetic and De Maria\'s ball is heavy. Down to Lee Ufan for some serious minimalism and then another bus to Miyanora. A ferry and then a train to central Okayama. To The Coffee Bar for coffee, nice ginger ale, and a partially frozen creme brulee. We relax in the hotel a bit before heading out. We walk to the river and look at the beautiful black castle. We both get real sweaty. We want to try the local style of udon and walk for a while to a place only to find it is closed for the night. We find another that looks good and eat there. I order one with spicy miso and Liz a cold one with beef, quail egg, gobo, and fried fish stick. It is all delicious. The udon is firm, chewy, and long. Next we get real sleepy and go to bed.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"34.458938, 133.996997","From":"Jul 20, 2019","To":"Jul 21, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Naoshima, Okayama","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Q95uNkVW9w8vGdpm8"},{"City":"Taipei","Trip":"Come Again?","Id":230,"Photo":"","Description":"We land at the close airport and take a bus to our hotel. Rest a bit plus nice times. We walk to a very good boba stand for an oolong with taro, milk, and boba. Then we take a bus up north to Shilin Market. It is quite bustling. We rediscover the basil and egg pancakes we loved last time and get one. After a bit we smell a stinky tofu stand and see a long line for it. Needless to say we hop in. The tofu is fried in cubes with a crispy outside and a spongy center, which perfectly sops up the funky cabbage, sweet sauce, and spicy paste in the bag. It is fantastic; even weirded and better than we\'d hoped. We stroll a bit more and then head back to the hotel. Nap a bit more and then to Draft Land for drinks. All of the cocktails are on tap; we order a South Island Fizz: Kaffir gin, falernum, lime, mangosteen mats soda; English Milk Punch: brandy, dark rum, cinnamon, apple, sugar, lime. Next round is Special: chili, rum, vinegar, whey and Hop Heads: IPA, oolong vodka, sherry, and a round of truffle fries. All are delicious and cheap. Next we walk to Bar Mood for purple potatoes, pork spare ribs, Sweet Osmanthus Blossom: Bulleit Rye, Osmanthus syrup, Carpano Dry, lemon, egg white, smoked plum and Tyrant\'s Blessing: mezcal, tea syrup, basil & lemongrass syrup, lemon, grapefruit, basil. Walk back.<br><br>A morning chat with Liz\'s family for a bit then we head to Starbucks for caffeine. We ride a bus to Yongkang and ete at our favorite soup dumpling restaurant. We order a bunch of soup dumplings plus cooked green onions, a pork roll, onion black pepper buns, and black sesame buns. Everything is incredible. Up to the contemporary art museum for some contemporary art. Back to the hotel for a shower and then across the street for massages. Mine is painful and awesome. Next we walk to Indulge for chicken consomme, chicken liver pate, romanesco stir fry, and pork. They accidentally bring us the wrong pork (which is not very good), and they are out of the one we wanted so we get chicken wings instead (which were also not very good). For drinks we sip Imperial Honeydew Cocktail: imperial honeydew tea liquor, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, cherry, spice and Lingering Autumn: rum, Osmanthus, autumn plants, shiso. Second round is Dream Big: bourbon, sour mash, Mandarin Napoleon, amaranto, black walnut, bay leaf. Grain in Ear: tequila, mango, agave, lime, orange blossom, charcoal roasted oolong beer foam. We go back to the hotel to \'lie down for just a few\' before heading out to the next bar...there will be no next bar.<br><br>We do some Father\'s Day chatting with dads and get more massages. Liz has her feet massaged and I do cupping, which is weird, painful, and oddly relieving. Onto Toasteria for halumi with pesto, hummus, and a grilled cheese with lemon caper aioli. It is very good. Next to Huashan 1914 Creative Park.

At 1 we head to Hale, a vegetarian restaurant in Nishiki Market, for a yuba mushroom don set with many wonderful sides of tofu and veggies and a fermented fruit spritzer. Next to Sou Sou where we pick up a nice black and white tenugi. We walk by a shop with nice leg designs and bought matching shirts. Onto Fushimi station and to Vermilion for an Orangina and espresso drink. Into a moderately busy Fushimi Inari. Liz wants to do the whole hike. We find some charming shrines, a few friendly nekos, a sulfur cured egg, and superlative kitsune figures. We ride the train to Face House, which is a house that looks like a face and then walk to Sake Bar Yoramu, which is a small bar that serves exclusively rare and unconventional sakes. The owner is very knowledgeable and helps us to appreciate some very interesting sakes; one of which had been aged in the bottle for twenty-two years and tastes to me like a moldy french cheese. We walk home and sleep for a long time.<br><br>A lazy morning with conbini coffee and a flan crepe. We walk to Weekenders Coffee for a dark roast and a light roast cold brew. Both are excellent. Bus ride to Aonigiri, which it turns out is closed. We find a local beef curry restaurant where we eat a beef curry and a beef hash omurice. Next we begin our many hours-long stroll down the Path of Philosophy. We mostly skip the bigger temples and focus on small finds like a pretty black dragonfly, tako ni neko washi tape, cats, hydrangeas, and a mouse shrine. Back in the city we find a good and cheap antique shop where we pick up a flower vase. Onto Yasaka and then the Geisha district, which is pretty dead. We try going for Mexican food, but it is closed so we head back to the apartment for a bit to relax. We eat way too many gyoza at Chao Chao and try to go to a gin bar, but it is closed. Next we walk to steam-punky L\'Escamoteur for a Death in Provence: Absinthe, lavender, lemon, sugar and a Rossi Gin Fizz: Tanqueray, absinthe, vanilla, cream, egg, citrus, sugar. After there have a bit of difficulty finding F.S.N., a bar run by a French guy who plays old Metallica. A man at the bar compliments Liz on her \'deep voice\'.

Got on the ferry and got the premium cabin again. Read some book and ate some food. Got off a few hours later in Wellington and hit the road. Grabbed a Macca after a few more hours and got to Whakatane at around 10. Chatted a bit and to bed. <br><br>Juanita was having some car trouble and we soon realized that we would have to take the van, whose name she informed us was Wakka Two Lips (not Tulip) up to Auckland. First we snacked on a yummy pork roast she had made and some pickles. Hit the road and made it up to Auckland in a few hours. Hung in the hotel for just a bit and then headed to Woodpecker, a Texas BBQ Asian grill. We had some delicious food including beer batter fries, frickles, tiger prawn dumplings, tempura eggplant, fermented chicken, and Korean-ish pork ribs. <br><br>Juanita said goodbye. We checked out and walked to Best Ugly Bagels. They were playing Jailbreak when we walked in and a charming man who reminded me of Miguel was shouting along. Had a Humdinger with hummus, tomato, and zaatar. We also had another Boss Hog and two maple iced coffees. It was all so good we then decided to get a King Kong, which featured a tasty caramelized banana whipped shmear and a chewy chocolate bagel. Walked to the hotel. Liz napped a bit and I drew what could be perceived as a figure masturbating to white noise...it was the first time I\'d drawn in a while. Watched Dead to Me and drank a bottle of red wine. Took and Uber to mini golf to find it closed. Went instead to a different mini golf, which was right next to the hotel. The theme was military, kiwi (the bird) and dinosaurs. We both played well, but I won by one point. Walked next to Amano for dinner. Stracciatella with fig, shallot, and honeycomb. Crayfish pulsante with garlic, lemon, and dill. Pappardelle with lamb ragu, olive, pangritata. Fell asleep with the lights on. <br><br>Had a nice buffet and Liz headed to work. I hung for a bit and then treated myself to a massage for being a good driver. Found a good looking place nearby and did that. Had a nice woman work my back real good. Picked up another kombucha, which made my grand total for the trip at least a score. Went downtown and stopped by AS, a nice basics store where I bought things only in black. Bought some tickets for that night for two shows as part of the NZ Comedy Fest. Headed up to the room and proceeded to eat coconut Whittaker\'s and watch BlackkKlansman. Headed to BurgerFuel, which Juanita had recommended, for an American Muscle and a vegan burger. They were quite delicious. Went to Q Theatre next to see James Acaster, who is one of the best comedians I have seen in a while and had a great set. After that we headed directly to the next show (next door) for a trio of Australian comics. Michelle Braiser mixed vocal loops and had a heartfelt piece about wanting to fuck Aladdin. Demi Lardner had dogs for shoes and ate soap. Aaron Chen didn\'t do any of that funny business, but had plenty of his own. <br><br>Kissed my lady, went to the airport, and got another bagel.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"-37.953380, 176.996689","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"Juanita","Locations":"Picton, Whakatane, Auckland","NumberInTrip":4,"One":"-41.293945, 174.775733","Two":"-37.953380, 176.996689","Three":"-36.849648, 174.763762","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7"},{"City":"Part 3","Trip":"Road Trip NZ","Id":227,"Photo":"x","Description":"We had planned to get up early and hike around Mt. Cook, but the morning was rainy and gray. We opted instead to head to High Country Salmon, a local salmon fishery, for an Eggs Benedict and a bagel, both with salmon. They were quite good. The weather was cloudy and rainy, but we decided to try our luck with Mount Cook anyway. Headed up past the sparkling blue lake and up into the valley. We hung in the car for a while and watched some Twin Peaks. No change in the weather, but we decided to do the hour return hike anyway. It was beautiful and well worth the wet toes. Started to drive back down the mountain and, as we later found out, had our multi-rib belt snap on us. Spent the next few hours figuring out what was wrong. Had some wine and food on the side of the road and slept there for the night. <br><br>Made some \'Tow?\' signs for the car, but didn\'t get any takers. Called Gary, the electrician and mechanic who came and picked up the van. He dropped us off at the backpackers hostel in Twizel and we hung in the lounge for a while to charge up and finish Twin Peaks. Chris, another charming local man, checked us into our room. We did some laundry, showered up, and relaxed for a while. Eventually we headed out to Ministry of Works for dinner. We had a very good burger, and a pizza with chicken, cream cheese, rosemary, apricot, and cashew. I had a nice local pale ale while Liz had first an apple crumble cider and then an apple rhubarb cider, both of which were quite good. <br><br>Checked out. Chris offered to drive us up to High Country Salmon where we started with coffee and a caramel bar and then had salmon nachos and a salmon Thai curry. It was very crowded with tour groups. Walked back to town and found some very good looking mushrooms along the way. Stopped into poppies cafe to warm up a bit and have another coffee. Stayed by the fire quite a while and had a honey banana smoothie. Found out we wouldn\'t be getting the car today so we booked another night at the hostel and relaxed a bit. Wrote some postcards and picked up groceries. Dinner was yogurt roasted cauliflower with pesto pasta. We were too tired to watch a movie. <br><br>The car was ready around 10:30. We got on the road then and headed through the very beautiful Lindus Pass, which featured golden rolling hills backed by craggy snow-topped mountains. Headed next to lakes Hawea and Wanaka. The glacial color was not as pronounced as it was in the Twizel area lakes, but there were some hints of emerald and jade. Made it to the Cardrona hotel next where we had popcorn squid, frickles, lamb skewers, and garlic bread. Caught sunset hitting a large mountain just as we came into view of the Wakatipu Basin with Queenstown at the far end of it. Had a quick stop in the revamped mining town, Arrowtown, just as the light was fading. Pulled into our camper spot in Queenstown just after dark. Did some grocery shopping and decided to snack and watch Picnic at Hanging Rock rather than venture into town for fish & chips. <br><br>Woke up at 6:00 and walked into town to catch our coach for our Doubtful Sound tour. Drove down Lake Wakatipu and through a very lovely glacial valley. Got off at Manapouri where we took our first boat from one end of the lake to the other. Took another coach through the steep and winding mountains to get to the tip of Doubtful Sound, where we caught our second boat. Cruised through the sound and learned much about the local history, flora, and fauna. Where the sound met the Tazman sea we stopped and said hello to the seal colony. Went back in for a bit and then turned off the engines. The captain made a vague \'no promises\' about seeing something special. About a minute later we saw a stirring in the water about 200m away. We began to see fins and before long we had about fifteen bottle nose dolphin friends playing around and under the ship. They showed us their tummies. Finished the boats and did the transportation in reverse. Back in Queenstown we headed to Blue Kanu and had a local IPA and essentially a strawberry pina colada to drink. For food we had pork ribs, black pepper venison, and kung pao duck nachos. Then a ginger colada. Bed bed. <br><br>Nice wake up times. Bought some cold brew concentrate and milk and finished off the delicious cereal. Cleaned up. Walked around the downtown a bit. Liz bought a nice jade necklace for her mum. We took the gondola up the mountain and did a couple of luge rides. Hiked up the Ben Lomond trail for a bit and found some incredible mushrooms. Headed to Erik\'s Fish & Chips for that. Next off to Fergburger for one of those. Drove for quite a few hours, listened to some great music like Houses of the Holy, Madness, and Les Paul & Mary Ford. Camped out in the same spot outside of Christchurch that we had done about a week prior. <br><br>Sat in the sun and read. It was lovely. A chatty forest ranger and I shot the breeze a while. Back to C1espresso for another lamb empanada, more coconut milk coffees, a cheesy pastry, and a savory muffin with butter. Hit the road and drove a while. Stopped in Kaikoura upon the recommendation of a woman in Queenstown. It was pretty and the beach was very stony. Wandered there a bit, found some very smooth stones, and got back on the road. Got to our campsite just outside of Picton and nabbed the last of twelve spots. Watched The Seventh Victim, an almost shockingly bad and boring film about a satanic cult with supposed homoerotic overtones.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-45.025900, 168.660436","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Mt.

Back to Best Ugly where we had a tuna melt and a chicken sandwich; both were stellar. Next we headed to the ferry terminal and took the three-hour ride to Picton, on the south island. Other than the jerk man who lied to me about his \'friends\' coming so as to not have to share his seats with us, it was pretty uneventful. Landed and were immediately in awe of how beautiful everything was. It wasn\'t too dissimilar from the north island, but the mountains were taller and the colors were more autumnal. Started heading south first trough some mountain passes, which had the softest fog lying gently upon them, and then down the coast. After a while we pulled over to check out the beach and snack a bit. We continued our five-hour drive south. It was pretty much non-stop gorgeous. We saw many seals playing on the rocks and in the water as we drove. Liz wanted to stay in a hotel so we did that in Christchurch. Got to our room, did some sink laundry, showered, and headed to dinner at Little High, a hip food stall hall. We had some nice local beers, a vegan burger with coconut bacon, very good chips with aioli/bbq sauce, and a pizza with cauliflower cheese sauce and fried capers. Back and to bed. <br><br>Headed to C1espresso for nice coffee and a lamb empanada. Played some Monster Bash pinball afterward where Liz got a score of 51 million. Drove towards Akaroa and we stunned again by the continuous and ever developing beauty. We stopped by the side of a lake and had some snacks. A big duck greeted us and basically squacked at us until (and past) when we fed it after we were finished eating. A few times it walked on to our towel and we had to shoo it away. Drove up some lovely mountains and Skyped with Liz\'s parents near the summit. Down the other side and into Akaroa. Parked by French Bay and Skyped with Mom and Jim. Explored the cute, very French influenced, town for a bit. Began driving up a very steep and very beautiful mountain toward the outer coast, but soon there was signage warning against camper vans from taking that route. We stayed at the top of the hill, which overlooked Akaroa, and caught an incredible sunset. Drove back to Christchurch and went back to Little High for dinner. We had a roasted broccoli from Bacon Brothers plus a spicy pepperoni pizza and a huge poutine from the pizza place. Everything was delicious. Drove to a campground just outside of the city and called it a night. <br><br>Began driving towards Mt Sunday, a.k.a. Edoras. All went well until about 20km from the site we came upon a very bumpy gravel road. We decided to continue through it, but I was a bit worried about the van falling apart. The entire area was basically Rohan, with rolling golden hills near to us and craggy snowy peaks in the distance. Made it to the parking lot for the hike, which was almost 2km each way. We we\'re in awe at the beauty throughout the hike. The water we had to walk through at a few points looked as though it has just melted off of a glacier. We hiked the quaint mountain; I was surprised at how small the summit was. You could hardly fit a single hall at the top let alone a whole town. It was windy and certainly looked like it belonged in a film. I left my sunglasses at the top. On accident. Began the longish drive to Late Taroko. We pulled up to the lake just after the sun dipped below the mountains, but we had about a half an hour to walk around and appreciate the views of the lake and mountains. From there we headed to the campground near the bottom of lake Pukaki. We parked the van, got out, looked up to the sky and we were both immediately in awe at how clear the stars were. The Milky Way was clearly visible and the entire sky was full of twinkling dots. We took some silly long exposure shots. Then we had some red wine with bread, cheese, and pate. Read for a bit and then tucked in.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"-43.535178, 172.640786","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Wellington, Christchurch, Mt.

Found someone to pay me back and got it done right. Bus to Manukau where we ate Indian food in a mall. Finished the ride to Rotorua and picked up the van. Dusted off the spider webs and did some practice driving around the neighborhood a bit. It went well so we headed to Warehouse and Countdown to stock up on supplies. Then we got gas, tidied up a bit and headed to dinner. Liz found Atticus Finch, where we ate roasted cauliflower with Dahl, coconut yogurt, & coriander; roasted greens, cashew cream, preserved lemon, quinoa & cumin crisps; lamb rump, veggies, tapenade, & feta creme. Parked on the street neat Lake Rotorua and settled in for the night. It was a bit chilly, but we slept well. <br><br>Got up and went to Epicurian downtown for some coffee. Bought a sourdough baguette and some incredible cheese from a passionate Italian man from the farmers market. Drove around the lake and found a nice grassy spot for a picnic. Liz napped a bit and I read. Got to Waitomo and did the Glowworm Cave tour. It was only about an hour long, but the cave was wondrous and the worms, which are actually fungus gnat larvae, were very mesmerizing. Checked into to our camping spot for the night and relaxed a bit. Headed back to the caves for the Ruakuri Cave tour. There were only four of us plus the guide, Demi, who was very cool and informative. She was happy to let me take all the long exposure shots my heart desired; well, a reasonable amount anyway. We wandered through an expansive and stunning cave system for about two hours. We found more worms, pupa, and a fly. We met tubers. We saw some stunning limestone formations. Demi mentioned a nearby bushwalk that was great at night so after the tour finished we checked that out. Saw more glowworms, a loud waterfall, and some scary spiders. Came back to the hostel and made a dinner of beans & fried egg on toast, ramen noodles with Piri Piri tuna, the rest of our farmers market cheese, and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Showered and worked on computers for a bit before heading to bed. The temperature was perfect and the drizzle of the rain made for a lovely sleep. <br><br>Had some muesli with milk and hit the road. It was a day of much driving and a good bit of rain too. Had a Macca lunch and, eight hours or so after beginning our drive, we pulled into Wellington. Went downtown and ate dinner at Chow, a mostly vegetarian, pan-Asian restaurant, where we had some nice, though unremarkable, small plates. Headed to a marina parking lot/camp site and settled in. Watched some twin peaks. <br><br>Headed back downtown and got Best Ugly Bagels. Maple syrup iced coffee, poppy with cheese, and bacon, cheddar, egg, rocket sauce on sesame. Walked to Leeds Street Bakery to pick up some sourdough and have a salted caramel cookie. It was rainy out so we headed into Milk Crate and had an iced coffee. Got a parking ticket. Back to Milk Crate and had a hot ginger drink. Wandered the downtown area some more and killed time looking in a bookshop and a record store. We were planning on going to get tacos for lunch, but when we arrived we were not feeling enticed. We were, however, feeling quite enticed by the Malaysian pace right next door. We ordered some satay, a veggie curry, and the most incredible roti bread I\'ve ever tasted. It was lightly salty and also sweet. It was hot and chewy, while being just a bit crispy too. Headed to Miramar peninsula for the Weta tour, which included a miniatures tour for the new Thunderbirds Are Go television show and also the Weta Cave tour, which gave a glimpse into the variety of work that Weta does. It was quite cool, though less LOTR focused than I was hoping for. We drove along the coast through the evening fog until we reached the airport. We did not have a flight, but we were hoping to see the Gollum statue in the terminal. Inside we learned that they had taken it down, but we did see Smaug\'s head and Gandalf riding on Gwaihir. Next we stopped at a grocery store to pick up hummus, cheese, and salami for dinner. We first parked in the same camper lot as the prior night, but I became nervous about getting a fine—we were not technically eligible to stay in that lot. As we left we saw a park ranger who I am pretty sure was checking vehicles. We tried parking along the side of the road, but it turned out to be quite a busy road and was a bit scary. In the end, we tried our luck back at the camper park and ate and slept in the car.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-41.293945, 174.775733","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo, Wellington","NumberInTrip":1,"One":"-37.006683, 174.784614","Two":"-38.145085, 176.248911","Three":"-38.267987, 175.078463","Four":"-41.293945, 174.775733","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7"},{"City":"Seoul","Trip":"Second","Id":224,"Photo":"x","Description":"Took a cab to the hotel and slept for a while. We were feeling uninspired and were about to eat tacos, but at the last moment we passed by a dak galbi place and opted for that. We had good kimchi, nice soup, a big tray of dak galbi with cheese and various types of rice cake, fried rice and soju. Then we headed to Alice, where we drank barley water. Amuse bouche: white wine, orange, hibiscus. Reflection: .cacao nib scotch, lapsang tincture, amaro vermouth. Teddy Picker: banana rum, cold brew, Sherry. Next door basically to Le Chamber. Hello Seoul: soju, burnt rice, egg white, cinnamon. The Botanist: Gin, butterfly pea syrup, lavender, lemon, egg white. Bed.<br><br>Had a hotel breakfast and relaxed a while. Took a bus towards Insadon, but it changed directions and we got off in a different area. Fortunately, we were right by Gwangjang market and went inside. Ate a pork pancake. Went in a restaurant where we drank Chestnut beer and had. Walked around that area a bit and got a saltef butter caramel shake from Shake Shack. Took a bus back to Gamgnam and headed to Keeper for I ____ it: Ardbeg, passion fruit, lavender, agave. Marscapone Gin Fizz: gin, cheese powder, vanilla, double cream. He also gave us a White Rabbit (named by Liz): kombucha, carrot juice, white whiskey, birch syrup. Also they gave us \'girl drink\' shots on the house for posing in an Instagram photo for them. Home and Twin Peaks.<br><br>Breakfast and Twin Peaks. Changed hotels. Walked by City Hall and down the canal street until we hit Insadong. Egg cornbread. Bugolgi pretzel roll. Wandered the street and were left a bit uninspired. Tried to find good coffee, but settled on Starbucks. Took a bus to the Charles H bar. Old Crawford Punch: Jamaican rum, Cuban rum, mango, house chai, Curry leaves, clarified milk. Midnight Zombie: Caribbean rum, Genever, Calvados, passion fruit, cinnamon, lemon, dry sherry, absinthe. Headed back to the hotel and met Manav and Kartik for happy hour. Tried to find the fish stew alley, but apparently it was closed on Mondays. We did find a nice street stall where we had some rice cakes, veggie gyoza, and a chicken/onion skewer. Walked some more and came upon a fried chicken alley. Picked a place and had fried dried fish, a seafood pancake, good fried chicken and beer. The boys called it a night and we went to Marque D\'Amour. The space was well designed and featured many peacock busts that blended into the ceiling decor. First we had a sweet welcome drink. Then a Soft Rain: Cocchi Americano, sherry, lime, patchouli. Dark Flowers: Diplomatico, sherry, fernet, melon. Both were quite good. From chatting to our bartender we learned he was very good at flare bartending, but that he wasn\'t allowed to do it here. We asked him what types of flare drinks were common he made us something called a peach crush. As we were paying, he also made us all shots of whiskey sours. Lastly, they gave us two tickets to a Picasso exhibit at a local museum. Being nice to people has its perks.<br><br>Had breakfast with Liz and then she went to work. I had trouble getting my computer online. I headed out to the market again and found the fish stew alley. After an involved process of picking all of the tiny bones out I was able to enjoy the lovely and spicy dish. Took a bus to the museum. The Cubism exhibit was pretty cool, though not very large—I was through the whole thing in a little over 20 min. Took a while getting back to the hotel, but made it in time for lounge happy hour drinks and dinner. Met Liz and her colleagues out at a chicken and beer place for Tom\'s going away do. It was a lot of fun and lifted my spirits after a day of some waiting and frustration. <br><br>Got up early and flew home.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"37.526207, 127.041115","From":"Mar 9, 2019","To":"Mar 13, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Seoul","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"Takaragawa","Trip":"Onsen Weekend","Id":223,"Photo":"x","Description":"For a Valentine\'s getaway we thought we\'d treat ourselves to a weekend in the onsen resort of Takaragawa. On Saturday, we awoke early, had a bit of trouble getting our JR Passes, and barely caught our train to Gunma. Made it there and then caught the ryokan shuttle bus for a winding, 45-minute drive through the mountains to the resort. Checked in and hung in our lovely room. Napped for a bit and then headed to the indoor onsen to wash. After that we walked the outdoor path to the main onsens, which were outside. There was snow all over the ground and it was actively snowing. After a couple of minutes we arrived at the onsen area, which consisted of three large pools all sat along the river. We went into the first pool. For as cold as it was outisde (about -3C), once we were in the toasty spring water we felt amazing. The pool could have easily held over 200 people, but probably only had about 20 at the moment. The outdoor pools were mixed gender. The women were all given \'bathing dresses\' while the men feigned modesty by holding small towels over their appendages when they got up to walk. It began snowing more heavily, but we stayed in for quite a while to take in the view. Eventually, we heade back to the room and watched some Charlie Chaplin videos. I gave Liz some very nice chocolate I had bought the previous day in Tokyo. At 6pm we went to the ryokan restaurant for our kaiseki dinner where we were served pickles, sashimi, shrimp, tofu, salted river fish, tori nabe, broccoli & mushroom cream soup, umeboshi with apricot, and fresh fruit with whipped cream. Though it was still quite early, we were both so wiped after dinner that we went straight to bed. <br><br>Awoke and had a decent buffet breakfast. Spent the day combining snacking on chocolate and red wine, touching, watching Twin Peaks, eating ice cream, and hanging in the onsen (both indoor and outdoor). At 6pm we again went to the kaiseki restaurant for a similar meal, with slight variations in meats and preparations. This time we had mackrel, a beef nabe, and salmon sashimi. All were incredible. Finished twin peaks and slept for a bit. At around 9:30 we headed back out to the onsen (they are 24hr) for a dip in the dark. It was wonderful and we stayed out there for about an hour. <br><br>Breakfast again and checked out early to catch the bus back into town. A woman sitting behind Liz on the bus became sick and, fortunately, had a bag handy. When we got off Liz also got sick. Though it was cold and we were tired we still decided to head to Takasaki as it was on the way back and free as part of our JR pass. We did so to visit Shōrinzan Daruma-ji Temple, which is home to Daruama dolls. We visited the temple and saw many, many darumas. We bought ourselves a mid-sized white one, which makes our current collection three. From there we headed home where I made a nice dinner of fermented tomato water shrimp with a dessert of fermented banana, marscapone, and manuka honey filo wraps. It was a beautiful weekend.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"36.846597, 139.047628","From":"Feb 9, 2019","To":"Feb 11, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Takaragawa, Takasaki","NumberInTrip":1,"One":"36.846597, 139.047628","Two":"36.329816, 138.957278","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/6fyxcKr47fiZ3jfGA"},{"City":"Hakone","Trip":"Revisiting","Id":222,"Photo":"x","Description":"Played with fermented bananas and took our time getting to the Odakyu line. Stopped in Odawara to check out the castle. As we were walking to the castle a nice woman started chatting with us and invited us to a prayer ceremony. We politely declined and proceeded to check out the castle. Headed back to the station where we picked up some pork & shrimp dumplings and a few maki. Took a switch-backing train the rest of the way into town. Headed straight to the Hakone Open Air Museum, which we explored for a few hours. We love many of the pieces, the layout of the park, and especially the Picasso museum! Took the train one more stop to Gora and checked into the lovely Hakone Tent, which is a charming hostel/hotel. Took a dip in the private cedar onsen which felt very nice and was quite hot. Had a fruit tea in the kitchen then started walking to the brewery. On the way we saw a meowing cat in front of a conbini. We bought a can of cat food to give it, but right as we opened the can a cat grandma walked by and said hi to the cat; they proceeded to walk off together. We continued walking with the open can of food and after a minute came upon another meowing cat who seemed to appreciate the unexpected dinner. Got to the posh restaurant/brewery, had some beers with grilled shishito, crispy rice, and aburi salmon. Came back to the hotel. Had some hot sake and a great miso cream pizza. To nice Japanese women sat at our table and we chatted for a bit. Back to the room for some nice times and sleep.<br><br>Hit the onsen again, had a nice breakfast where we chatted with a French woman, and had more nice times again. Took the cable car up the mountain and then the ropeway back down. Took some very nice pictures of Fuji and got on the boat. Read some Princess Bride and got off at Motohakone. Waited a while for some yummy pastries and walked along the water. Took a bus to Hakone Yumoto. Wandered around there and bough some local citrus chu-hais. Back in Odawara, we were immediately approached by three women who seemed very interested in what we were about to do. When we said we were just heading to the grocery store, they immediately lost interest. That, couple with our prior experience with the overly kind woman led us to search online and discover that Odawara is home to a particularly aggressive sect of Buddhism. We avoided them and bought some nice veggies and a steak to take home.

Watched the Lego Batman movie on the plane and ate a potato omelette. Got a Grab to the Four Points and got early check in because of Liz\'s platinum status. Slept, made a French press, and hung a bit. Got a ride to Atlas, a very incredible bar in one of the most stunning buildings we\'ve ever seen. It is done in an elaborate art deco style and is referred to by locals as \'The Batman Building\'. We ate fries with horseradish bacon mayo; pinxos with carrot, dill, and marinated anchovies; and a lobster roll with Marie rose dressing.

Watched 2001: A Space Odyssey in the room. Finished a month old sandwich. Lazed a bit and then headed to Dapper. Had some nice cold coffees and read Harlan Ellison. Next to Amoy St hawker market. First we had prawn mee, a spicy dry noodle dish with prawn and crackling. Next we had fried kway teow, which, as far as we can tell was basically a delicious clam and sausage pad see eew.

On the way we passed a building where about 30 rats had made a playground in-between a wall and decorative grate which gave the viewer a similar effect as looking at an ant farm, but for rats. The wall was a well-lighted facade feature of a posh building, which made the event especially entertaining for Liz and I. A security guard came by to see why the two of us were so enthralled with this wall and also found the need to document the experience.<br><br>Chatted with Mom for a bit and had a big buffet breakfast. Checked out at 2pm and headed to the National Museum of Singapore for a Polaroid exhibit and a quick walk through the history museum.

Back to town and to Yongkang Beef Noodles for the eponymous dish, which was nice and underwhelming. We were about to call it an early night, but we happened to be near Alchemy, so we went in for a drink. Milk Punch: cognac, dark rum, milk, vanilla, Angostura.

Tried our luck at finding a scooter rental place that would rent to us (most only rent to locals) and got one on our third try. It was perfect weather. We drove through town, then along a highway - with it\'s own scooter lane - and into Taroko Gorge. We spent a few hours cruising up into the mountains, checking out temples, and taking in the unreal sizes, shapes, and colors. Made it back into town right before sunset and caught a train back to Taipei. Liz had to work a bit so we hung at a Starbucks and then at a Mos Burger, where we had a rice bun wagyu burger.

We were very lazy and took a long time to get moving. We checked out of that and into a new hotel. There we relaxed some more. We eventually headed down to Yongkang Street again and went to Jin Ji Yuan. We had a yummy pork roll, which was reminiscent of an English sausage roll. Then we had pork soup dumplings and another kind which had a shrimp on top. It was all incredible and quite cheap. We walked south and wandered around Shida night market before heading up to Smoothie House for a sugar overload in the form of a mountain of shaved ice topped with raspberry, strawberry, mango, and strawberry ice cream. It also came with a side of custard. We opted for a quiet night in and a movie, though we ended up just falling asleep.<br><br>Another lazy morning of coffee and tomatoes.

Took a train to Tainan, had a boba sugar milk, and checked into our tree house hotel. Hung there a while and then headed out to explore the town. Found a place that specialized in a rice porridge with pork and shiitake. There we also had a nice dumpling soup and pork with sauteed greens. Wandered some very charming streets and found many cats, great architecture, ornate temples, and interesting street art. Headed towards Shennong Street when we passed a cafe that had many cats inside. We went in, played with some cats, had a huge rose milk tea and a creamy boba toast. They also treated us to an incredible crème brûlée cheesecake. Down Shennong where I bought a nice vegan leather wallet then headed back to the hotel for a bit. Headed to The Checkered Record Club. There was a wait so we headed to a small food stalls serving incredible danzai (noodles in broth with ground pork, shrimp, and a brown egg). Back to TCRC for a tequila, orange juice, and elderflower drink for Liz and a mezcal, umeshu, pineapple, and black pepper drink for me. Back to the hotel where Liz had a long night of work. <br><br>Liz had a work call so I wandered the city a bit in search of a danbing (tortilla egg wrap). Found an awesome one at a market right next to the hotel and brought them back for Liz. Cleaned up then headed to the station to catch a high-speed train to Taipei.

We ate a delicious beef curry pan on the plane while I read of troubles in Bree. Checked into a not-too-smoky room. Slept a while. Woke up and walked to Inasayama where we took a ropeway to the top and enjoyed a magical sunset follow by pretty glittering lights. Walked back to town and took the trolley downtown. Had a bad Singapore Sling in a charming antiquated CD (music) bar. Wandered and found a cool looking tiny bar with an eyeball on the door, but we\'re turned away by the trans probable racist tender. Went to a sushi place that looked nice. A lovely man and woman at the counter translated for us that we would need to wait about twenty minutes. About six minutes later they came out and apologized for taking so long, then gave us their seats and also bought us possibly the best chutoro we\'ve ever had. On top of that we had some incredible ika, ebi, tamago, uni, aburi saba, anago, and local sake. We enjoyed it so much Liz recommend we book reservations to come back again the next night so we did. <br><br> Headed to NGS Coffee for a delicious iced chestnut latte and a hot chestnut hojicha latte. We were a bit disappointed to find our tour boat would not land on Gunkanjima because of typhoon damage, but we did the cruise anyway (as they wouldn\'t give us a refund). It was pretty awesome to see. Went through Glover Garden and saw a church. We had a short rest in the hotel and then took a train to Konagaicho; a small town that has fruit shaped bus stops. Saw a few of them until it got dark and took the train back to the sushi restaurant. Had a whole bunch of lovely sushi. A weird older man came in and left before too long. A sweet Japanese couple bought us an akadashi miso soup. We chatted with them a bit and, before we parted, they invited us to join them for breakfast the next morning. <br><br> Got picked up by Satoshi and Ikuko. They drove us to the port fish market for a stellar and very reasonably priced kaisendon breakfast. They dropped us off at the Peace Park where there were many tourists. We then walked to the hypocenter park where we heard school children singing to the monolith. Next to the Atonic Bomb Museum. Had another chestnut coffee from NGS Coffee then headed downtown to wander, look for neko-ni-takos, and look at a pretty bridge. At a pork bun and some delicious soup dumplings.

Saw a very cool art deco building mixed in with the geisha houses. Headed back to the hotel and grabbed some conbini food on the way. We both fell immediately asleep. Later I checked out the onsen where I sat outside (on the roof of a 14 story building) in a very hot pool and let the rain drizzle on me. It was nice. <br><br>Watched some Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and ate melted ice cream. Went to the museum, but they wouldn\'t let us take bags in so we said fuck it and went to a shrine where we bought some more inari statues.

Liz got business and had some nice food. I had egg salad on a hot dog bun and watched part of Blade Runner 2049. Landed and took an hour long can ride into the city for $20. Checked into our hotel. We were both wiped so we napped for an hour. We were still wiped so we kept sleeping a while. Got up and went to the metro station. Took the train to Hongdae. It was a cute, lively area with interesting architecture, lots of restaurants, and many people out on the street. It felt like a much larger version of Cat Street in Harajuku. In many ways, Seoul immediately felt like a more laid back version of Tokyo. That being said, we found ourselves using the work \'brusk\' often when describing interactions with the locals. We went into a beauty shop and bought many face masks and also foot masks. Walked on a bit and had nice chicken skewers from a street stall. On one street watched people play a carnival style balloon dart game, some teenage kids practicing their dance moves, and people doing street karaoke. More beauty shops, brutalist architecture, and Danish mid-century furniture. Stopped into a grill restaurant for pork tripe with belly meat and a strong, smooth soju. Then we headed to Bar d.still where I had a BCG (beet, cherry, grape) that was nice, though a little flat. Liz had a Wild Style with gin, lemon, egg white, and Galliano. Took a cheap cab back. <br><br> Took our time getting up. Ate a nice buffet breakfast. Watched some End of the F***ing World. Chatted with Scott for a few. Moved to the posh Plaza hotel after watching some Mongolian singers. They upgraded us to a very nice room. Went to the club and had some snacks. Walked through some palace grounds and visited a modern & contemporary art museum. There were some nice pieces and we mostly preferred the abstract stuff. Bought some more face masks and headed south to Maple Tree House for grapefruit soju, and Korean BBQ including: miso, kimchi, pork jowl, marinated pork collar, and a nice beef striploin. Took a bus back and went to bed. <br><br> Had breakfast in the club lounge. Hung out in the hotel for a while while Liz prepped for her meeting later in the day. We met Yeo Kwang in the lobby. He was so sweet and seemed genuinely so happy to see us. We headed to a great chicken soup restaurant where we spent the next hour catching up. The food was great, though I lost my appetite slightly when an old woman sat down beind us and proceeded to make disgusting snorting and spitting sounds for the next thirty minutes. I later asked Yeo Kwang if that was a normal behavior and he said it was definitely not! We said goodbye to Liz, grabbed a coffee, and headed towards Gyeongbokgung, the ancient royal palace. We spent a while wandering the grounds, he taught me a bit about Korean hihstory, and we discussed music therapy ideas. I saw him off and began heading back to the hotel, when I notice I was right next to the Korean Contemporary History Museum. I went in and spent the next hour and a half learning about the past 150 years in this peninsula. It was pouring when I left, but I really wanted to see the comfort women statue outside the Japan Embassy so I walked over to that. There was a guard watching the statue, to presumably discourage vandalism. I bought a few tops from Uniqlo, picked up some snacks for later, and headed back to the hotel. I quickly went up to the club for happy hour where I had some nice vegetable lasagne and taught the attendants how to make a Negroni. Liz surprised me after a few and we snacked and drank some more together. We headed back and she immediately fell asleep. <br><br> I worked on my video game for a while. Then I drank a bottle of soju and looked at abstract art. I convinced a reluctant cab driver to take me to a mediocre burger restaurant. Next I took a bus back downtown to get my bag and meet my Liz. After a quick stop in the airport club for a drink and some snacks we caught a flight and I finished Blade Runner 2049.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"37.565900, 126.973693","From":"Sep 1, 2018","To":"Sep 4, 2018","People":"Yeo Kwang","Locations":"Seoul","NumberInTrip":1,"One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/BZJkce6VeZEdAdar5"},{"City":"Ishigaki","Trip":"Hot Beef Island","Id":215,"Photo":"x","Description":"Made a standby flight just in time to avoid the typhoon that was about to hit Tokyo. Landed and caught a bus to Ishigaki City. To the hotel and relaxed for a bit. Got up, ate a delicious burger from a stand down the street that is connected to a yakiniku restaurant, and headed to the port to catch a bus to a beach. We met a lovely, sassy woman at the info counter who informed us that it was way too late in the day to try to catch a bus to the beach and also that Ishigaki is renowned for the beef from the cattle raised there. She recommended we visit the island\'s oldest temple and a nearby garden, which we then did. The temple was old and the garden was serene, from the front at least. We then walked to the cute town shopping area where Liz got a pineapple popsicle and a drunk man asked me some questions. Came upon a live music and dance performance, which we watched for a few. Then we relaxed in the hotel and watched some OITNB. At one point I went to Family Mart to get a taco rice maki, Pringles, and some very delicious pineapple-shikuwasa beer.<br><br>Took our time getting up the next morning. Had some chanpuru and Blue Seal ice cream for breakfast. Checked out and caught a local bus up to Kabira Bay. Walked down to the beach. The water varied in shades from deep blue, to seafoam green, to emerald. There were a few glass-bottom boats docked along the beach which were regularly ferrying people to a nearby reef. We walked down the beach for a few minutes and found a shady spot under a steep bank. We stayed there for a few hours while we slept, read, explored the sea life, and I got sunburnt. We saw hundreds of hermit crabs, some sea cucumbers, snails, pretty blue fish, and a big starfish. Headed back up to a restaurant where we had a beef croquette, a soba dish, a beer, and then a soft serve. Wandered around the park area and then stopped by a local awamori distillery where we picked up a bottle. Caught the bus down to Fusaki Beach, which we had to walk through a resort to arrive at. The water was protected by nets and lifeguards because of the many jellyfish that live in the waters. We swam in the warm, salty undulations and lay on the beach until the sun dipped below the clouds for the evening. We then took a bus back into town, checked into our new hotel, and took showers. Walked down to Ishigaki cattle Maru, where we had some local yakiniku, hot-stone bibimbap, and sours. We had picked up some more of the pineapple-shikuwasa beers and were planning on watching more OITNB, but we were both so tired we came back and fell immediately asleep.<br><br>Woke up ten and half hours later. Had some coffee, Spam onigiri, and beers and watched an episode. Checked out and took a bus to the ANA resort hotel beach. It was quite hot and neither of us were really feeling this beach, which had many kids running around, so we caught another bus a little while later and hung at the airport instead. We ate a Spam-don and one last goya chanpuru before catching a flight back to Tokyo, where we had quite conveniently missed out on the typhoon.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"24.338284, 124.157782","From":"Jul 28, 2018","To":"Jul 30, 2018","People":"","Locations":"Ishigaki","NumberInTrip":1,"One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"Osaka","Trip":"Pachinko and Prostitutes","Id":214,"Photo":"x","Description":"For some reason I didn\'t take notes on this trip.

We visited the National Museum of Art and learned about a few new Japanese artists. I listened to a wonderful street performer who sounded like a one man Sigur Ros. We actually tried Pachinko. It was very difficult to understand, our machines kept beeping and giving us error messages, and people kept trying to help us even though we were helpless.

It was a very small beach that had a lot of people on it and was quite littered. They were very strict about exactly where we could kayak, which was only the route from the pickup area to the beach. Back to boat for tea, relaxing, and dinner. Many nice Vietnamese dishes. Liz completed a Vietnamese wood puzzle and we unsuccessfully tried squid fishing.<br><br>It was a rainy morning. We, as a group, decided to skip early kayaking for more time exploring the bay. Switched to the day boat. Played Vietnamese cards inside as we headed towards the floating fishing village.

Under an natural rock arch and then back to the day boat. Lunch with nice fried pork rolls. New folks on the big boat and the same kayaking beach trip as the prior day. Drank tea with a nice sunset. Ate a many course dinner. Sim (a 20-ish local woman who worked on the boat) was very charming and very committed to making karaoke happen. We finally got someone\'s phone to connect to the PA and I sang All Star to a few Australian families and the Vietnamese crew. It was a bit odd, but there was nothing else to do on the boat so people seemed content to keep it going. Some of the kids braved the crowd and sang a few songs I didn\'t know.

Dinner at the Izakaya next to the hotel. Had some Goya Chanpuru and yummy fried squid. Got some beers from the conbini and drank on the beach until late. Liz and David both got quite drunk. At 3am Liz and I decided to head back, but David wanted to stay up and go and meet the people whose voices we were hearing across the bay. He hung out with them for a while and then got lost coming back and took 2.5 hrs to find the hotel. <br><br>Up very late, 4pm late. To a cute island. Ate some soft serve. Found a dead fugu on the beach. Watched a pretty sunset. To Heart Rock just as it got dark. Back to the hotel. They fell asleep at 8. At midnight I ordered Dominos for everyone and we watched some Ugly Delicious about pizza.<br><br>Slept past the hotel breakfast time so we ate at Family Mart. Down to the central part of the island. To a fish market for lunch. Then to some very old castle ruins. To Ikea island. There were hard waves and the water was chilly so we took a nap on the beach. To a cute vintage car motel. Dinner at King Taco for delicious tacos and taco rice. To a pool hall for some pool. Had some drinks on the balcony. <br><br>Coffee and Okinawan donuts for breakfast and then to American Village.

Every couple of minutes he appeared to get bored with the track and would cut to a new house track. Some Thai ladies in at least their 40s would at times go up and give him a lap dance.

I found the area with the best looking food carts and picked up fried rice and grilled chicken. Brought some back to Liz and we watched Moone Boy.<br><br>Breakfast fried rice. Dara picked us up and we commenced our Angkor tour. First to Angkor Wat. Through the bridge tunnel. Saw monkeys and pigs. To Angkor Thom. Ate at a touristy restaurant with great food. We had coconut shakes, \'spicy\' sour fish soup, and pineapple chicken stir fry. To Bayon, a temple with many faces and many tourists at top. Liz still wasn\'t feeling well so we took a break for a little bit. Next to Preah Khan which had two moats and a very cool tree growing up through a two story building. Liz was all done. Took the tuk tuk back. She threw up in a park and then felt a bit better. Hotel sleeps. I went solo to Marum for a young coconut lime shake, a red ant beef kafir stir fry, and a tea smoked chicken dish with chinese broccoli. Brought some back for her.<br><br>5am pickup from Dara. To Angkor Wat for the sunrise. It was beautiful, but overall too cloudy for much of a sunrise. Had sweet coffees and eggs with bacon & cheese at a place Dara took us to. Next to Ta Prohm (a.k.a. the \'Tomb Raider\' temple). Then to Banteay Kdei where we were hit with a sudden rain. Back to the hotel. Showered and had nice ribs and a fish paste and pork \'dip\' at Viroth\'s. Picked up again by Dara. To Kampong Phluk floating village. It was quite pricey and our \'tour\' boat was driven by boy. By a pretty village. He pulled over and we were told to get off the boat. We were then told to pay more for a different boat (a rowboat through the mangroves we would soon find out). It may have been nice, but we weren\'t expecting any of this sudden change and were already unhappy about paying so much for the initial tickets so we said no and got back on the first boat. It was weird and we felt pretty uncomfortable. Went by the mangroves and then to a big lake. We sat there for a few min still on the water and then went back. We couldn\'t find Dara at first. When we did we complained a bit to him and he seemed to feel quite bad. To Bakong, our final temple. He bought us a coconut to apologize for the bad time we had. We were very grateful and had a nice time after that. We walked around the temple for a while. The imps were cute. They followed Liz around and tried to (did) scare me. They cracked up. There was lovely live music coming from the monastery next to the temple. Back in tuk to hotel. Peed and then went to the airport.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"13.426192, 103.859557","From":"Oct 11, 2017","To":"Oct 15, 2017","People":"","Locations":"Phnom Penh, Sihanouk, Siem Reap","NumberInTrip":3,"One":"11.565077, 104.932512","Two":"10.606478, 103.521259","Three":"13.426192, 103.859557","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oAltPZBprdyyPjEq1"},{"City":"Sihanouk","Trip":"Cambodia","Id":179,"Photo":"","Description":"To Deluxx Hotel which was located in an alley.

Ate some good falafel in town. There were many clubs with loud music. Went to a club called Absinthe. I ordered absinthe (on of the few there who do I\'m sure) and Liz had a tropical drink. Picked up some pastries for the morning.<br><br>Ate the pastries and had coffee in the lobby while some asshole American abused the staff. We wrote a limerick about them I can\'t share here. To PK bar for a Bloody Mary and a Watermelon Bellini. Moved to a new hotel. Had a sleep. Got up and ate gyros at Lucky\'s. We both got pedis from a nice local woman. Visited a church on a hill. Ate gelato then had beer and snacks. Hotel pool hangout. Touch. Bed.<br><br>Rented an 150cc ATV. It had some trouble with hills and the trunk was zip-tied on, but it gave us the ability to tour the island in a whole new way. Had some bad pastries. To Parissa Beach. We had coffee and a cocktail. Had some chili and nice water. To the next beach. Ate at a restaurant with a great view that overcharged us for fish. Drove down some dirt roads and saw beautiful churches. To Red Beach. We hiked down to the very red beach at the bottom of a tall cliff. It looked very susceptible to a sudden landslide. Had some sugary drinks in the parking lot. Next to Akrotiri lighthouse at the end of the island. Hiked around there a bit. Did a meal at a nice restaurant where, when we drove by earlier, the woman owner gave us a big genuine wave and smile. It was an absolutely charming place where we had eggplant with garlic, baked cheese with peppers, moussaka, and homemade strawberry and chocolate ice cream bars for dessert. We bought some caper leaves and sun dried tomatoes in jars from their shop. I wish we could go back there over and over. We drove up to the highest point on the island and were treated to stunning views. Below us was a misty, fantasy world. Drove next to Pyrgos, our favorite town on the island. There were no roads here, just alleys. If M.C. Escher and Gaudi designed a town, this would be it. We saw many cats. It was basically true cat castle. Found twelve cats inside and out of one cute shop where we bought some bowls. We had baklava with ice cream. We caught the sunset as we were driving down the mountain. To Lucky\'s again for gyros.<br><br>Visited a magical grocery store near the hotel. It was dimly lit inside and smelled a bit stale. The meat & cheese cases looked like they were in a forest. Hardly any space was untouched. Nothing was in it\'s packaging. Every nook and cranny was fitted with an item. To Fira for coffee and gelato. The woman behind the counter praised us for our manners. Lucky\'s gyros again. I wanted to ride a donkey down to the port. Liz was not so fond of the idea, but acquiesced. It was frightening, exciting, and smelly. The port was nothing special so we took the cable car up. Napped. To Santo Winery where we hung for a few hours while doing a tasting of 18 smallish glasses of wine and more cheese than even we could eat. There was not much of a sunset due to the heavy haze, but we thoroughly enjoyed it all. A bunch of Americans flagged down a bus and got back to Fira.<br><br>ATV excursion day 2: the north half. Started with pastries, coffee, and a 300cc ATV. It was a much better machine. To a nice, but hot beach. Didn\'t stay long. Next beach. Ate at a quaint restaurant that took a very long time to serve us. Liz was a bit grumpy about this in addition to the fact that the food wasn\'t very good. We followed a tour group down to what we found out was a nude beach with beautiful views of cliffs.The group left and there were only a few folks around. I partook in the removing of clothes. Liz did not. The weather and water were great. I went swimming, but my mind was stuck on the though of sharks nipping off my favorite bits so I didn\'t stay out long. Drove to Ammoudi bay. There were octopodes hanging on a line. We ate tzatziki fries, grilled mussels in mustard sauce, and grilled squid. Back to Fira. More beer & Lucky\'s.<br><br>Rode a dizzying bus to Oia. We arrived to our freshly built, surreal-minimalist hotel. Went for a swim in the cool pool. Back to Ammoudi Bay again for a not-as-good-as-before meal. Walked up the cliff. Saw some sweet dogs and caught a crisp sunset from the steps. People clapped for it and it was pretty adorable. Had baklava and ice cream. Liz bought a ring. Picked up Olives and Cheetos from a shop and snacked on them while sitting on our balcony.<br><br>Liz woke up early to look for a kitten. No luck. Back to bed. Explored Oia a bit and had crispy pita, tzatziki, stewed beef & tomatoes, and roast lamb with onions & garlic for lunch. Back to Fira and then the airport.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"36.364512, 25.382425","From":"May 29, 2016","To":"Jun 4, 2016","People":"","Locations":"Athens, Santorini","NumberInTrip":2,"One":"37.977399, 23.729855","Two":"36.364512, 25.382425","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://goo.gl/photos/63hdLZKgXPUy9r7z8"},{"City":"Athens","Trip":"Greece Lightning","Id":133,"Photo":"x","Description":"People clapped when we landed in Athens.

Ate a lunch of salmon, whale, rice, salad, bread. We cruised by a massive glacier. It was the first glacier I had ever seen and I was in awe. There was too much ice out still for us to be able to go to Pyramiden, an abandoned Russian mining town, so we stayed on the boat and continued our tour. It was very cold in the boat and it was difficult to get comfortable.

I get looks from locals that seem to inform me this is not the place for tourists. I head to El Poblado, a place meant for tourists. I eat a bad carne fajita cone from a clean corporate fast food restaurant. I want to hear some live music. I find a group, but they are busking directly to couples on the street and mostly interested in tips.

An older, vagrant man has a small crowd around him. I\'m not sure if he is an entertainer, a preacher, or mentally ill. He takes a lit cigarette and places it into a toy gorilla\'s mouth. Next he makes tubes by rolling up paper. He takes out a razor blade, demonstrates that it is very sharp by slicing up pieces of newspaper with it, and then runs it along his neck and the palm of his hand. It doesn\'t part his skin. He then unbuttons his shirt to reveal his nipple, which is pierced with a safety pin. Hanging from the pin is a small cloth bag. He opens it, which contains a few diamond shaped black pebbles. He lifts up a cup of what looks like water with food coloring in it. He places the stones in the water. They absorb all of the color, turning the water clear. I can\'t read the expressions of the faces of the crowd, but none of them look as confused as I surely do. I leave. In the museum, I take in the beauty of the voluminous Botero figures. I walk to Pergamino where I have a tasty coffee and watched the fútbol game with a room of about 60 people. Colombia wins. The streets are a joyous party for the rest of the evening.

Not at all charming the way Imperial Palace is. We relax have some nice times in the room. It is evening now.

We catch a bus to our hotel. It drops us off about a block from the hotel, which happens to be Vancouver\'s equivalent of Skid Row. We are surrounded by homeless people. It is a very strange sensation. No one interacts with us. We are in a bit of a state of shock. We say nothing aloud, but we have each decided we will cancel the hotel. When we cross the last block to the hotel we find the mood suddenly changed. It is as though the large homeless community consciously decided that their area ended at that corner. The concierge reassures us that the neighbors are not a problem. We decide keep our booking and thoroughly enjoy the hotel. After relaxing a bit we walk downtown and admire a very talented roller skater/dancer.<br><br>We get up and head to Stanley Park where we rent a tandem bike. It is a bit tricky to ride at first, but we find our balance before long. After returning the bike we find some cheap sushi, which is not very good. More poutine, this time in the gay district. It is cold out so we go to the movie theater and watch Looper. We are feeling cheeky—and cold—so after Looper we sneak into see The Master. We head to Greyhound terminal early (though late at night), but it is closed. We try to sleep on the street, but it is too cold so we enter a nearby McDonalds.
