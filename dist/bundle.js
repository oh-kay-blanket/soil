A nice bun and something they called a tofu Vietnamese taco, but I would call a cruchwrap supreme loaded with fries and honey mustard. I roll up my pants and wade in the shallow sandy water. Under some coral I spot what I think is an octopus, but we eventually learn is a Spotted Worm Sea Cucumber. It pokes its little vacuum cleaner head out and ends up stretching over two feet out beyond the rock. We can see there is still much coiled under the rock so he must be a big boy. We hit the Super U for some groceries and make for the house. It is nested deep and up in Opunohu Bay. The house is a perfect beachy foresty bungalow with a wrap around deck that overlooks a lush downhill grade into the inlet and then up the other side to jagged peaks of juicy green canapy and black rock that dissolve into mountain scraped clouds. Selma shows us around and gives us a fat loaf of banana bread. We\'re all pretty tuckered so we zonk out for a few hours. We come to, have some drink and cook up delicious sausage with sweet potatoes. After table chatting we\'re zonked again and say good night.<br><br>A very productive morning of snacking we make our way out. Our first stop is Belvedere Lookout, a high point on the island that is on the rim of the volcano crater. It overlooks the valley of the crater and offers a spectacular view of both bays. Down from there we lunch at Snack Mahana. We sit in a little hut right on the water and dine on breaded mahi mahi with coconut milk plus, of course, poisson cru. It is fantastic. We see another worm cucumber plus a ton of regular cucumbers, fish, a long needle boy and a shark. Around the cove a bit more to a public beach with only a very narrow strip of sand. I get in to snorkel, but the waves are a bit rough for comfort and good visibility. After taking in the not-so-sun a bit more we continue around the island, stopping regularly to admire the astonishingly beautiful views. Liz gives us the very good idea to stop by the macaron stand where we enjoy some passion fruit mango and caramel delights with tea and coffee. After winding out way back around the island we retreat to the house. It is cool and rainy. We turn of all the lights and watch the sky slowly turn blue, then deep purple, then black. Silhouettes of craggy mountain tops and palm fronds blend into the rain. We sautee onions, eggplant, taro and shrimp with a coconut pulp sauce for supper.<br><br>The night is cool and rainy, as is the morning. Tea and treats to wake us up. Anne and Richard are feeling more of a relaxing day so Liz and I head out on our own to the beach. Fortunately, the rain tapers off and we\'re left with an increasingly gorgeous day. We take turns snorkeling. There\'s a stunning variety of fish in the water. Lots of neon stripes. From there we wander on. The Thai food truck we want to try is closed. Nothing else looks particularly appetizing so we just grab stuff from the store. There is a Route des Ananas that connects the two bays via an inland road so we give it a go. It\'s not too pretty, but connects us back up to the Belvedere road, so we nip up for another view before coming home. A bit of snacking and the Millers are ready to head out. Back to the beach for some nice views and doggo pets while the sky turns dark. Our neighbors drew a big penis in the sand. Back at the house Liz and Anne cook up a yummy dinner of rice noodles with pork, mushroom and the kitchen sink in a Polynesian sauce.<br><br>I awake with good energy and decide to hike Magic Mountain. The whole thing is paved and takes about 25 minutes to get up, but it\'s brutally steep. The view is worthy. Back and pack and check out. Up Belvedere again for the clearest skies we\'ve seen yet. A bit down from that is an archeological site. We hike down through the tropical forest. It is a raised floor build with evenly stacked, fuzzy green stones. We stop at Le Pa\'i Hot for cocktails, stir fry shrimp, club sandwiches and a banana flamb√©e. Towards the end of the meal we get a very good and loud rain. More counterclockwising around the island. We kill our last bit of time at a beach dipping our toes into the water, cleaning up broken glass and pspspsing cats before we get the ferry to the plane to the plane home.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"-17.506177, -149.850914","From":"Oct 24, 2023","To":"Oct 29, 2023","People":"Anne & Richard","Locations":"Tahiti, Moorea","NumberInTrip":"","One":"-17.496795, -149.494410","Two":"-17.506177, -149.850914","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/izyfwkGBeoEWHXHg7"},{"City":"Tahiti","Trip":"Something Old, Something New","Id":"309","Photo":"x","Description":"I kiss babies on their heads and Tony gives me a ride to the port. A cleaning woman yells \\"Chica! Chica!\\" to warn me that I\'m going into the men\'s restroom. I land in LAX, eat a $20 grilled cheese and meet Anne. Before long we\'re on our flight to Tahiti. Hertz didn\'t have a car when we landed so we get a taxi to the residence and wind down. Soon enough we\'re up and out. We walk to Papeete Market, a big open air market with lots of stalls, by tuna plus a bunch of veggies to cook up for tonight. After that we find a little cafe nearby and have some lunch. I have poisson cru avec coco and Anne has an American breakfast. After a bit of wandering Anne mentions the idea of renting a scooter, which we investigate and find that there\'s some pretty awesome electric scooters we can rent. It takes a little while but we get it sorted and now have some wheels. Back to the house to put the stuff in the fridge and relax for a bit. At around 4:00 we get up and drive east to Venus Point where we hang for a couple of hours and watch the beautiful sunset over Moorea. We cruise back through the dusk and cook up the groceries at the house. I try to stay up, but am wiped and had to bed shortly after.<br><br>I wake up early and go out for a morning scooter ride through the industrial district and look at the seawall. I then head inland and find more industrial areas. At the top of the road is an abandoned cement truck that\'s being overgrown with ivy. I have some tea with Anne and then return the scooter to pick up a car. Once we\'re together again we head east along the main road. Our first stop is one of the gorgeousest waterfalls I\'ve ever seen. As we\'re driving into the valley we put on the Jurassic Park theme song, which is the most appropriate thing I could imagine hearing right now. We hike a good bit to see two more less-impressive-but-still-very-impressive waterfalls. Along the way tiny iridescent rainbow lizards enchant us. Back at the parking lot we chow down on two chunky, perfectly ripe, juicy, carroty and dare I say slightly herbaceous mangoes. My legs are dripping. Good thing I changed out of my white linen pants before the hike. We continue down the east road. We encounter a resting point to allow a construction crew to do their thing. It\'s a great opportunity for Anne and I to bond. Soon enough we reach the eastern end. Here is a sleepy beach with girls in t-shirts practicing something I\'m sure they don\'t call hula dancing. Silky black sand between my toes. Hazelnut in my tum. The pizza place in the island waist town is shuddered, but we both secretly wanted McDonald\'s anyway. The girl laughed when I asked if they had honey mustard. Back up the western side. Lots of pretty glassy water and misty green mountains. At the grotto we find some funky flowers and stay for a very mellow sunset over the serene water. Back at the house we dine on more tuna banana coconut soup.<br><br>I return the small car and get a bigger car. By the store for some groceries and cough syrup for Anne. We drive back down the western coast and check out a public beach. We find ourselves a nice shady spot and settle down. Anne brought a snorkel mask so we take turns exploring the absolutely stunning sea life. In just a few minutes with my head below the surface I see probably a hundred different types of fish. I am swimming around a massive dentists office fish tank. A bit further down the road we stop into a very posh beach bar with an incredible view of Moorea. I drink a mocktail and we snack on various yummy bites. Our next stop is to pick up Liz and Richard at the airport. Big hugs. After a quick feet up at the house we hit the road to Venus Point just in time for a pretty, though nonspecific sunset. After a beer run we make for the food truck caravan where we dine on grilled fish and chicken plus some mandatory poisson cru. Back home for beers and sleepy time.<br><br>Up an on the ferry to Moorea.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"-17.496795, -149.494410","From":"Oct 21, 2023","To":"Oct 24, 2023","People":"Anne & Richard","Locations":"Tahiti, Moorea","NumberInTrip":"","One":"-17.496795, -149.494410","Two":"-17.506177, -149.850914","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/izyfwkGBeoEWHXHg7"},{"City":"Austin","Trip":"Lotta Flaca Ninas","Id":"308","Photo":"x","Description":"After work we drive south for I think four hours and meet the crew at Meanwhile, a big outdoor brewery with lots of food trucks and a live band.

For lunch we head to KG BBQ for Egyptian Texas fare like pomegranite-glazed ribs and BBQ lamb belly.

We\'re not sure why exactly, but Prissy is not in favor of us being here or trying to touch her. We do anyway.<br><br>Coffee & yummy donuts. We drive down to Ruby Falls, which is a pretty cave with a big waterfall about a half a mile in it.

To downtown for umbrellas and silly photoa. We walk to the super cute Dwell Hotel and visit their bar, Matilda Midnight, for some delicious drinks. Next to Unknown Caller for a few rounds of drinks plus a whole lot of 90\'s trivia. A charcuterie board at the house sounds so far away, so we stop at a nice pizza shop and get a food neopolitian with N\'djuja and honey. Then to bed.<br><br>I finish An Amerikan Family, eat a donut and have a good talk with Krys. Devyn makes breakfast tacos using the leftover steak from the other night.

After some good spooning we hail a taxi and scoot to Guanajuato. En route, we drive through a series of underground tunnels, complete with intersections. We ascend into the the very charming, colorful, colonial town. It is hilly here and the buildings are painted in many bright colors. We meet up with Rob and Tony at the Don Lucas hotel and soon head for a stroll. The brick-lined streets are narrow and and shady with trees. It feels closer to San Marino than anything I imagined Mexico to look like. I get regular peeks down streets of the house-lined mountains, which is reminiscent of Valparaiso. There is a big church and then a shady, restaurant-perimetered square. It is sunny and 78¬∞. Bands are playing competing Norte√±o and Mariachi. High at the top of a mountain is a large statue of what looks like a Roman god. Tony leads us through a maze of streets. Men dressed in pseudo-Shakespearian garb encourage us to participate in their troubadour-led bar crawl. We find a similarly shady restaurant-perimetered square and sit down for some micheladas and a platter of meat. After hanging there for a good while we explore the mercado. Rob tells us he\'s been coming here since before Liz was born and that it hasn\'t changed at all. I buy some earrings that are molcajete. More wandering and the back to the hotel for siestas. In a few hours we wake and head to their room for a glass of wine. Rob is craving pozole so we head out in search. We find a very cross laden establishment and get that plus some other classic Tex Mex fare. More wandering and then heladlo on a stick. We\'re all wiped, so off to bed for us.<br><br>I wake up early to the sound of our AC unit taking a big wee on the floor. Downstairs for coffee. Soon we\'re out and heading up the funicular. The view is stunning, as is the esquiche. I am very tempted by beaded jewelry. Back down, an orchestra is performing in the center park, so we sit and enjoy Boody Marys while we listen. Later, a less sophisticated marching band carrying a bust of Jesus toots on by. Onward to the Diego Rivera museum. We spent probably 90 minutes taking in some great art. Well worth the $2 entry. When we walk out we find R&T seated in a restaurant across the street. It\'s a small, charming, queer-friendly spot. I get a jug of delicious pulque, which is reminiscent of kombucha. We snack on cuitlacoche quesadillas and drenched tortas. A girl is making a quinceanera video via drone on the steps of the museum. Siestas. We stroll the streets in search of food. We initially set out for pizza, but determine Mexican is probably our best bet. Hot dogs seem to be a big deal here. We decide to try the molcajete Liz saw the other night just in front of the hotel. We\'re in the big square in front of the church. The barrage of stimulus is constant. People asking/selling. Competing Mariachi bands. Impersonators. Dogs. The food is fine. Back to the hotel for a bottle of red and Juanga.<br><br>Breakfast. We\'re still tired and go lie back down. Eventually I come to and decide to walk. I head up the windy steps and, before long, I\'m at the Pipila statue. I get the cute earrings I saw yesterday and walk further up the mountain to meet the guys at a hotel bar. We drink Bloody Marys and talk about the history of this place. Tony points out the building that is the site of the first battle in the Mexican War of Independence. The place where Pipila strapped a stone slab to his back to block the conquistadors\' gunfire and crawled up to torch the door. Back down in the Jardin, I reconvene with Liz, share a slice of cheesecake, meet back with the guys and stroll. We buy a cute bowl. Further on we are tempted by a Japanese restaurant. We dine on bento and sushi. We attempt to get a free chomurro at the square, but it\'s not on offer. To Van Gough for beers. Many musicians serenade us.  It\'s now been a little while since the trip. I\'m trying to remember everything, but it\'s a little bit guessy from here. We head back for a bit of a siesta. We meet back up and head to a restaurant next to the crossy one. They serve bread rolls and salsa. Liz gets carne asada and I enfrijoladas. Rob is pretty wiped and heads to bed. The three of us wandered for a bit. Tony takes a photo of Liz and I kissing in kiss alley, though I think we do it in the wrong part.<br><br>At 3 we get a cab to the airport. We fly home and go straight into work.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"21.014688, -101.254637","From":"Sep 1, 2023","To":"Sep 5, 2023","People":"Rob & Tony","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/J9YLbybpeWh6xrnp6"},{"City":"Fischer","Trip":"Boyz \'n\' Betty","Id":"305","Photo":"x","Description":"I drive down to Austin after work and, in a few hours, arrive at the Philosopher\'s Playhouse where I drop off my stuff. I get a ride to Ego\'s where the boyz are busy getting started and singing some great karaoke including Fucked by a Redneck and Linkin Park. Over to King Bee for a casual chatting vibe and then to Outer Heaven for a Macho Man and tequila vibe. I ride back in Pabba\'s Tesla and we nearly rear end someone just after critiquing Elon Musk. Back at the playhouse, Matt bought 50 pounds of ice and makes an ice bath. He, Caleb and Anthony go all in. Ben and I dip our toes. More drinking and DJing. I sleep under the pool table.<br><br>We clean up and head to Batch for kolaches and coffee. Ben and Pat ride with me to Fischer. Ben asks to stop by an Amazon locker to pick up a box of Pussy, an energy drink he ordered just for the weekend. On the way down we decide it would be great to get a blow up sex doll for the river. Just as we mention it we see the unmistakable purple sign of an adult shop. We stop in, speak with a lovely attendant and get what we came for. Soon we\'ve met the girls and are all on the river. Betty is a hit and we hit the tubes. We pop on some country, crack some beers and have an all-around good time. We quickly realize that the wind is cutting out nearly any progress the river is making. I eventually jump out and pull all thirty or so tubers downstream until we get to a point with a little more movement. From there it\'s mostly smooth sailing with the exception of a few bumpy rapids. We hang for a bit longer, somebody pops Bettys cherry and we head for Roughhouse. It\'s a great spot for nice drinks and good snacks. In a bit we say goodbye to the girls and head to the house. It\'s way out in the country. There are two cows in the field behind us. We settle in and pretty soon I start on food prep along with Michael, Pat, Caleb and Ben. It all takes a while, but in time we have a pretty good feast of fajita and fajita adjacent items. Caleb brings out Wavelength, a very good board game that we play for a bit. More time out back and then some POLISH, which a very fun and chaotic ping pong game, which I appear to be not very good at. More drinks and then bed.

We land. Our driver is a quirky lady who tells us about a group of local teenage girls who hijacked a teacher\'s car and decapitated her by driving off while her foot was caught in the seatbelt. Alexa and Joe meet us at the hotel and let us in. After a quick chat and giving him some homemade caramels Joe says goodnight. We help Alexa finish her tequila and then she and Liz head downstairs for a big drink and a couple of little drinks. I wrap up some work. The ladies come back. Liz considers a pizza, but instead opts for the pillow.<br><br>To the cafe for an orange creamsicle cold brew and a Pina Colada cold brew plus a boudin sausage roll. I work all day. Liz takes off around 1 and helps Alexa put some furniture together. After work we meet Joe at Meril, a sister (daughter) restaurant of Emeril. We dine on bone marrow drizzled oysters, candied ribs, cornbread, turkey necks, tuna tacos, BBQ shrimp, melon with prosciutto, cinnamon toast crunch bread pudding and chocolate creme brulee. It is a very delicious meal. Up to the bar for some more drinks and a chat with the charming Damien. Joe opts to hang there while the three of us head to La Madeleine, a charming library/hotel bar with spider web chandelier moulding, for a round of delicious drinks. Nite nite.<br><br>More cold brew and pastries. At 9:30 we don our red dresses and meet Joe and Alexa downstairs. Joe has on a big red wig that is Bette Midler meets Hey Arnold. His dress has plenty of bust space, which leaves room for his two tap tits. His left breast holds blueberry lemonade vodka and his right fireball whiskey. The nipples are taps, which he uses throughout the day to top up our drinks and also to nourish the occasional passer by. The four of us walk down to the French Quarter and head to the predetermined meeting spot, a bar. April is already there plus maybe a couple of other people. She is charming and we quickly hit it off. More and more people roll in, all sporting some shade of red and some type of dress or skirt. After a good starting round or two we walk. Walking is slow and adventurous. There are plenty of distractions and plenty of red dresses. I love this. It\'s so comfortably queer. I feel gorgeous and not at all worried or self conscious. I think our next stop is Oz. A bit of drinks, a bit of dancing, a bit of maybe flirting with a cute guy at the bar and a bit of getting yelled at by the doorwoman. Walking again. I\'m still not used to being able to take drinks with me as I walk. The locals seem to plan it just right where they take enough to go that they finish it right as we get to the next oasis. It is hot out, but not as miserably hot as we had been prepared to expect. Between hopping from one shady spot to another and slowing for the AC rush pouring from tchotzky shops we manage to stave off any serious exhaustion. A zydeco band is grooving pretty hard in one spot. The man on washboard plays like he sleeps with that thing strapped to his chest. Another bar, another round. It\'s a fancy restaurant. I\'m amazed they let us in, see-through dresses, bikini bulges and all. It\'s now one thirty and we\'re probably due to eat. Fortunately Joe has already planned for this and made us reservations at Tujagues, a famous restaurant in the quarter that apparently invented the standing bar, the Grasshopper, and brunch. The boudin balls make me appreciate the squishy, rice-ingrained sausage for the first time. Joe has a special device that shoots out confetti when giving high fives. By the end of the meal our table, drinks and turtle soup are all extra colorful. Alexa gives us a tour of the very historic building. The meal is a very good time. From there we all part ways. We are beat from the heat and drinks so we head back for a nap. In a few hours I attempt to meet April again, but we don\'t quite align. I check out the Craig Tracy art gallery, where he has just done a live human painting, and shops for a bit. Liz and Alexa come by. After a gander there Alexa takes us for yummy cocktails and killer Cuban at Manolito. Back towards the hotel we stop for Capt\'n Crunch beer and Jager shots.<br><br>I think we leave quite early.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"29.946494, -90.068159","From":"Aug 10, 2023","To":"Aug 13, 2023","People":"Alexa, Joe, April","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/MsKy18FGYq93khMu9"},{"City":"Chicago","Trip":"Sweet Home Blue Meanies","Id":"303","Photo":"x","Description":"We catch the Blue Line to Wicker Park.

Fortunately there are comfy benches. The opener is not good. The Tossers are pretty fun, though the consistent mic feedback and totally self-indulgent lighting tech take away from my joy. Then come the Meanies. They are quite fun. Billy, the lead singer is a real sweetheart and gem. Liz is a very happy lady right now. We catch a ride to the Sheraton by O\'Hare and sleep for a few hours. Up early. They try to close the flight with three open seats on it, but Liz calls them out and they acquiesce.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"41.918592, -87.690168","From":"Jul 22, 2023","To":"Jul 23, 2023","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/arbGrNQZpV4s2asU9"},{"City":"Los Angeles","Trip":"Cori-Sean, John-John, Russel-Ron","Id":"302","Photo":"x","Description":"Our car is not here.

When the night is nigh, Sparks fly. The sound and lighting are fantastic. They sound great and are right at home.

To get in, Liz tells them were going to Maine to explore Acadia National Park. After lunch we get a car and drive into Philly. Our first stop is a pizza restaurant. They tell us to get the cheesesteak. At the hotel we work and eat the sandwich, which is unequivocally the best one we\'ve ever had. The bread feels artisanal and the beef/cheese/onion combo is umami ans creamy. Liz booked us a coursed dinner at Andiario in West Chester, so we hit the road. They start with fried peppers. Next is shaved cauliflower with fishy sauce. The rolled penne-ish pasta is heavenly. Next is a stunning crispy roasted hen. Last is honey and linden flower cake with honey ice cream, crumbles and honey drizzle. Gorgeous. All of it. We chat a good bit with Maria, a co-owner and FOH head, and also with Steve, who we realize we know from when we brunched at House Brasserie with Alexa, who he was dating at the time. After heading back to drop the car off, we walk to Bar where we meet Evelyn, Kelly, Kush and X. We drink White Claws, remember old times.<br><br>After working a half day we check out and head to Row Home for delicious pretzel breakfast sandwiches and cold brew. Onward to Quakertown, where we check into the Econolodge. It smells like old smoke. India and Parma greet us in the hall and let us know they\'re leaving because they found a bedbug. After thoroughly scanning our room and finding no sign of the critters we decide to stick it out. North to Kirkland Farm, where the rehearsal dinner is being held tonight. Many greetings. Sean & Cori are total babes and glowing. We dine on jerk chicken, cheesy mac, beer and pretty pies while connecting with Justin, Catherine and Nikhil. Justin shows us the baby pigeons he is overseeing. Speech time. Deb delights with a Mad Lib, Leigh presents a poem and Bryan gives us a (metaphorical) cube of sugar for our tea, not a bowl of custard. Sean shares his love of computer science by having us take part in a merge sort, arranged by date met them. Inside, at the pie zone, Jonna and Nancy speak of spluging cherries. More chats with Alex, Leigh, India and Parma. Water from Wawa.<br><br>Dunkin and then I go back to the farm for a morning yoga class around the pool. Deb loans me a mat. A doggo joins in. Back to the hotel. Soon we head to the Quakertown Farmer\'s Market, which ends up not being nearly as charming as it sounds. It\'s a big bazaar full of mostly junk. There is a Trump simp store. I\'m presenting moderately femme and am at least starting to be more okay getting looks, even in a place like this. We share some okay pizza. After a clean up we join many other on the shuttle to the farm. The chairs are arranged in a circle in a quaint glade. The bride and groom are seated amongst us. Folks are looking fab. A man, who is not an officiant, informs us that this will be a Quaker-influenced experience and that we will sit in silence for about twenty minutes with the caveat that, if someone feels compelled to share a brief thought, they may. We begin. The first five or so minutes is a peaceful and warm settling in. One person shares an appreciation of love. Another their awareness of the cosmos. Another that a spider is crawling on her leg. A couple more about love. Once that wraps up, Sean and Cori step into the center of the circle. They share what most might call vows, though they are more gracious thoughts on their partner. They then take turns sharing \\"five good things\\" about the other person. And then, refreshingly unceremoniously, it\'s done. The group moves up the hill for cocktails, cheese, veggies, figs, chatting and sun. One of the cocktails is named \\"The Marquis\\" and the other \\"The Loiselle\\". Liz finishes writing her speech. India and Parma connect. Selfies in the sunset. The cheese is sweating. After salad comes a delish dinner of lasagna, penne in pink sauce and chicken. India shares memories of POD and Toes in the Fan. Peter his journey from \\"teacher\\" to \\"friend\\" to both C&S. I Three Good Things I\'ve learned from Sean. Liz musings on justice. Hugs and soon their Sean and Cori-ographed dance to Still the One featuring a flash mob ending. Dandelion chocolate. Levaine cookies. The sun dips below the clouds and soon were led through the barn attic, which is a yoga/dance studio/reception hall. There are pretzels, pizza, and bottles of alcohol. We rest for a few. In time the music gets louder and the lights dimmer. Lots of dancing. Very silly dancing. I believe in a fin cold luff and I like big butts. Jonna feeds us pretzel and beer. Loz lets me use her flats. Toes in the pool and soon the shuttle back.<br><br>We rise and head back to the farm. C&S have coffee and bagels ready for us. We sit with Barbara and Doug. We break down classical structures and talk Kids these Days. Back to Philly. Lunch is beautiful bagles Korshak\'s. Long hot pepper BLT with scallion schmear. Lox on everything. We eat on the plane to LA.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"40.539678, -75.305681","From":"Jul 13, 2023","To":"Jul 16, 2023","People":"Evelyn, Cori & Sean, wedding guests","Locations":"Philadelphia, Quakertown, Los Angeles","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/JLTjj49uvW5dPWps5"},{"City":"Worcester","Trip":"Mass NY","Id":"300","Photo":"x","Description":"On Saturday we try for three flights before calling it quits for the rest of the day.<br><br>We try for a late afternoon flight on Sunday and make it. We land late, get a car, drive west and arrive at Kelly and a Chris\' place in the wee hours of the morning. We chat for a bit and watch some How to with John Wilson. Then we go to bed.<br><br>I wake up at 11:30 and make coffee. I sit near Yaga, but she\'s not into it so I hang in the kitchen and read. We stop by Wendy\'s and head to Framingham Public Library. Kelly demos a very cool laser cutter and gives me a Framingham Pride Bookmark she made with the 3D printer. I find Santi\'s book. We pick blueberries out front. Back at the house we hang and soon prep dinner. We start with blueberry G&Ts and caramelized onion dip. For mains we do roasted broccoli & cabbage and salmon en papillote. Dessert is blueberries and ricotta in crescent rolls.<br><br>A late morning. After 3 we drive west and a while later meet Paige, Eric, Jack and Noah at their home somewhere near a dairy farm and an abandoned golf course in western MA. Jack asks me if I\'m a boy or a girl. I go with \\"girly boy\\". They give us a tour, we play soccer out back and spend a good while having a nice chat. We head to downtown Northampton and get good stuff at Local Burger. Today is July 4th. We regularly hear small-scale fireworks going off. After dinner we walk through the dark and drizzly streets. Jack encourages us to come back to theirs for ice cream, to which we oblige. At 11:30 we hit the road back to Kelly and Chris\'.<br><br>Helen comes by and Kelly drives us to Gloucester, which apparently has one of the nicest beaches in MA. I have no other reference point, but this is indeed a lovely beach in a cove with soft sand and calm, warmish water. Quite a lot of other people had the same idea as us it seems. We spend a few hours alternating between the water and the towels. Kelly finds a dead crab. Helen likes trying to hear what nearby groups are talking about. The granita dealer appears to be lonely and expresses gratitude that I don\'t understand sign language. Kelly drives us through Salem and then we get junk food from a 7/11 before heading back home. Liz and I have a go at finding a Hinge match for Helen. Chris makes us an incredible, rhythmically flattened chicken parmesean and eggplant parmesan. We watch a few episodes of The Rehearsal and snooze.<br><br>Up earlyish and to Miss Worcester Diner for spam & eggs plus a Philly cheese steak omelette. The English muffin is griddled with browned butter and is something special. We head south and west, through Connecticut and into the Hudson River Valley. We arrive at Storm King, a 500 acre sculpture park in the woody mountains. We start by taking the tram on a ride around the whole of the park, getting to take in many of the metal, stone and fiberglass works from afar. We get off at the fourth stop, admire a three-legged Buddha, and wander on. Before long a thunderstorm rolls in and we run to the main hall just in time for a shelter-in-place lockdown. Fortunately it doesn\'t last too long and we\'re back out again. We march further on, but the heat is now brutal so we bend our way back towards the parking lot. We cool down and drive north to the hotel for a relax. In a while it feels like dinner time. We pick a promising pizza place in Poughkeepsie. The Cesar salad is the first sign we chose well. The dressing is house-made and plentiful with a confident declaration of anchovy. The tomatoes are soft and slightly funky, maybe semi-sun dried. Then the pizza comes. It\'s Detroit style: rectangular deep dish with cheese right on the dough and spread to the edges. The crust is buttery, crunchy, chewy and soft in all the right ways. The toppings pack a punch and balance beautifully. Good job place. Good job. We discussed the possibility of seeing Asteroid City, but opt to check out the bar next door, Goodnight Kenny, instead. I get a Naked and Famous and Liz a frozen rummy yummy babe. We end with a delish espressoey jello shot. There was talk of still watching a movie at the hotel, but sleep (and Zelda) win.<br><br>Early up. We first go to Dia Beacon for gorgeous spaces and ultra-minimalist art. Most of it doesn\'t do a whole lot for me, but the Louise Bourgeois attic is pretty stellar. We hit the road north and in a while we\'re at Mass MOCA. Thanks to Liz\'s very best planning we have four different special timed exhibits booked that we begin as soon as we arrive. The first two are VR pieces by Laurie Anderson and are pretty interesting. The next two are James Turrell works. The first of which is Akhob-like with strobe lights and the second reminiscent of the Naoshima church. Both are fantastic. We take in some more Turrell plus an EJ Hill rollercoaster, Bourgeois marble pieces, Kiefer concrete and Franz West appendages. We step outside for cheesesteak, beers, falafel and a singer/songwriter. After a good bit of that we head out back for a sunset experience in the Turrell Skyspace, which is made from a converted water tower. We spend about 30 minutes watching the sky turn dark as the room cycles through an array of complementary and contrasting colors. Each color gives the sky hole a different quality. Some awe. We drive back, hang with Kelly and Chris and watch The Mighty Boosh.<br><br>Liz and I join Kelly and Yaga for a morning walk. Kelly teaches us about many of the local flowers. Soon we drive to Evergreen Room in Hudson for yummy drinks and a beautiful charcuterie board. Halaena texts us to let us know that we are grandparents. Liz and I head on to meet Bryan, Michelle, Gigi, Cici, James, Petals and Natalie at their lovely home. We spend hours catching up, playing outside, talking horror movies and snacking on pizza. Back at Kelly and Chris\' we hang, watch Snuff Box and share our gratitude.<br><br>We wake at 4 and do all the stuff to get home to see the new additions to our family.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"42.701534, -73.116940","From":"Jul 1, 2023","To":"Jul 9, 2023","People":"Worcester, Northampton, Gloucester, Salem, Hudson River Valley, Poughkeepsie, North Adams, Sudbury","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"42.257842, -71.779162","Two":"42.701534, -73.116940","Three":"41.499695, -73.981570","Four":"41.424424, -74.058311","Five":"42.257842, -71.779162","Six":"42.319870, -72.628676","Seven":"42.257842, -71.779162","Eight":"42.382529, -71.415390","Nine":"42.257842, -71.779162","Ten":"42.652432, -70.688884","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/vys7wYCQoftAcHzr9"},{"City":"El Paso","Trip":"Unexpected Tiki","Id":"299","Photo":"x","Description":"We check into our hotel and meet the boys downstairs.

We have a couple of hours to kill before they need to return the car so we go for a drive up the mountains and take in a couple of nice overlooks of the city.

Our room is not the Lucifer, but Heavenly and nice. We meet Alexa at Cochon Butcher for cocktails, catch up and meat. We see her off to work and hit the road again. We chit chat with the Jo Malone woman at the mall, try on masks and stop in Fritzel\'s for a round of hurricanes in a charming alley that smells of cat. Maybe coincidentally, there is a house ginger cat. Liz says hi. He is aloof. We stroll Bourbon St for a bit and decide to pop into a bar for hand grenades and a terrace with a view. A server throws an old lemon wedge down into the street and hits a woman with it. We pop back to the hotel for a bit to relax, clean up and eat macarons before heading to Emeril\'s. It is, fortunately, a pretty quiet evening there and we\'re able to sit at the bar and chat with Alexa for a few hours. She starts us off with cute Ramos gin fizzes, which she tops with confetti. She makes us a few rounds of very delicious drinks and we get increasingly silly. She also keeps getting delicious food sent to the table like foie, tartare, ragu, Cajun shrimp and a s\'mores cake. A nice man in a bunny suit gets our entire tab. Once Alexa is off for the night we stop by a dive bar nearby for a final round. I maybe fall asleep at the bar.<br><br>I start the day feeling pretty not great. We get ready and catch a ride to Seafood Sally\'s, an adorable colonial cottage serving killer Viet Cajun delights. We do oysters with nouc cham, fried turkey necks with possibly more nouc cham, a big fabulous boil of crawfish, crab and shrimp that has a killer very Vietnamese sauce and some beautiful honey drizzled cornbread. I\'m feeling much better now. Back at the hotel we get dolled up in our gayest garb and make for the Gay Easter Parade in the French quarter. Well, first we grab a couple more rounds of drinks and then catch the festivities. It is so joyous and queer. There are a lot of families out, which is very heartening to see. The parade feels like a mix of Mardi Gras, Easter and Pride. We get tossed beads, bunny ears and a baby toy snake. We do a final round of drinks, give hugs and make for the sky.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"29.949179, -90.132758","From":"Apr 8, 2023","To":"Apr 9, 2023","People":"David, Alexa","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/pMKNah1QMt96uY3x5"},{"City":"Cleburne State Park","Trip":"Plunkett Camp pt 2","Id":"297","Photo":"x","Description":"I arrive at around 5.

Back at camp Justin grills up some delicious chicken fajitas, which Danielle made for us. After cleaning up, we build a fire, sing traditional American songs (Party in the USA) and make s\'mores.<br><br>I get up first and prep coffee. After my morning meditation I cook up bacon, hash browns and scrambled eggs. We take it pretty easy for a while with some hammock reading and a good bit of frisbee. I make us sandwiches for lunch and then we head out to Dinosaur Valley State Park, just past the Creation Evidence Museum. There are some very cool looking ____ tracks. Just next to them are some large holes, which we later learn are where people have cut out fossils and taken them. After the main tracks we see the Ballroom Tracks, which are under a bit of water and have a lot of kids running on them. Back to camp for more hammock time. When the sun starts getting low, Justin throws some charcoal in the pit and gets a fire going. We put the beans in the cast iron skillet and the dogs on the grate. It starts to drizzle so we set up the canapy over the pit. Dinner is yummy. We take in the fire and make another batch of s\'mores. It\'s a bit chillier tonight, so we tuck in not too long after.<br><br>It rained a good bit throughout the night and is still going. It\'s also quitre cold now.

Our first stop is Oscars for four kinds of fish taco. The weather is sunny and just warm enough to enjoy a casual stroll down the beachfront until we are ready to plop our bums in the sand and take a good long look at the ocean. After 180 waves we decide we\'ve seen enough. Up to a cove crowded with seals, sea lions, pelicans, pretty black-and-blue birds and tourists. Some of the tourists come too close to a big lion sleeping on the sand and get a firm-but-gentle reminder from the faceless lifegod in a tinted hut. Through the hills is a delicious little ice cream shop serving us a scoop of mango and sticky rice and a scoop of strawberry cheesecake on a beautiful, slightly cinnamony, waffle cone. Mothership is a bustling post tiki post apocalyptic space outpost. We squeeze into a standing spot at the bar and drain two drinks. Part Time Lover fronts and backs as a record store, but middles as a gorgeous cocktail bar. We clean two more glasses and I buy 180 grams of Hounds of Love. We sneak a cheeky Del Taco and retreat to the room for a crash. Wake, wash and ride to Juniper & Ivy for some pan-world fare of sourdough, hummus, salad, raviolo and gnocchi. It is fine until Liz finds mashed potatoes in the raviolo. That is not fine. We don\'t stick around to try any mashed potatoe cheesecake bullshit. Wolfie\'s Carousel bar is cute, but packed and not a place we need to wait around for. It turns out to be the same story for False Idol. Nothing else is giving us a tickle and we\'re both peckish for a pillow so we do that.<br><br>I get some cheap donuts and okay coffee to bring back to a sleepy lady. After checking out we make for Raised by Wolves, which we discover doesn\'t open for another three-and-a-half hours. Fortunately it\'s right next to Le Labo and Din Tai Fung so we stock up on perfume and dumplings. There\'s still a bit of time to kill so we make for Torrey Pines. The cliffs and waves are pretty. When we look up we see paragliders, down maybe naked beach dwellers and out dolphins playing in the swells. Through the rotating fireplace and we\'re in the fantastical wolf den for four fab fabulous fabrications. After our time with Taylor we check in and self care. We drop the car off at the airport, walk for a while to get out of the high price zone and then catch a ride to False Idol. Three cheeky rounds, swizzle stick earrings, so many glass globes.

We spend the next few hours exploring very good older European art. Some highlights are the Monet, Van Gogh and Ensor works. Back to the hotel for a nap and then back out to Petit Trois for soup a l\'ongion, escargot, a Big Mec and a filet au poivre. All are incredible and paired with lovely reds. We drive a few minutes more to arrive at Hatch for our Nest reservation. Nest is part escape room, part immersive theatre. We spend about an hour rummaging through a dead woman\'s storage unit and uncovering the tragic story of her life. It is beautifully done and evokes a flurry of emotions in me. Our last stop for the night is Walt\'s for some beer, pinball and a very fun sort of inverted pachinko game.<br><br>A casual morning and hearty hotel breakfast to start. After some relaxing we make for Langer\'s Deli for the most ridiculous pastrami sandwich I can conceive of. Dessert is a tall fluffy slice of strawberry cheesecake. We hoped to squeeze an architectural tour of Granada Hills in today, but the traffic won\'t allow it so we relax for a bit longer at the hotel. In a bit we make for Chromasonic, a Akhob-esque color and sound installation that Raphael\'s brother created. Unlike Alhob, Chromasonic has you lie in comfy reclined position, which is pretty nice. The journey is wonderful and feela great to take in. Another quick hotel stop before we make for Clifton\'s Republic, a three-story, proto (or maybe post) tiki cavern of curiosities.

Out front, a man is using a large magnifying glass to burn artwork into wooden planks. We don\'t get anything, though our needs are pretty darn specific these days, like a brass apple with butt cheeks. We walk for a few to Logan Street Market for a killer pastramied salmon and egg bagel plus a kouing amann. To the hotel where we nap for a couple of hours. Nothing sounds particularly enticing here food wise, but we\'re right next to a White Castle, which neither of us has been to, so we check it out. It isn\'t very good. Back to the hotel to get dolled up. We walk down to 4th Street with a plan to grab a drink, though the bars there seem pretty corporate looking. We head instead to Meta, a pretty hip cocktail bar, just south of the main drag. We each get a pretty good cocktail and then a shot. Just across the street is The Palace Theater, which is absolutely stunning. Liz describes it as a Venetian dream. The ceiling is particularly memorable, which is patterned with famous folks heads poking down towards us. The show is fabulous. Though our seats aren\'t nearly as good as those in Dallas, it\'s an absolute joy. As before, taking in the audience\'s attire is an event of it\'s own. We walk back to 4th for a slice of pizza and a beerr. Just as we\'re heading out, Johnny McGovern walks in and sits down next to us. We chat for a few and head back to bed.

We pass through two small towns. One is having a carnival today. The other has the circus in town. We park at Chiquila and get a ferry to Holbox. We walk through the wet, sandy streets and check into a very pretty hotel. I take a 15 minute nap, and then we walk into town. We get a mushroom quesadilla and a few tacos. They are on thick blue corn tortillas and served with beautiful salsas. The chef brings us some locally made mezcalito, which is quite good. We walk to the beach just in time for a colorful sunset. We play in the water and watch the sky slowly fade. After a stroll up and down the beach we make for a restaurant for nice mezcal cocktails featuring green tomatoes plus guacamole with crickets and some great tacos. It\'s not even 9, but we\'re both wiped and head to bed.<br><br>I relax and read by the pool for a good bit. When I come back we touch in the shower. Into town first for a juicy Mexican coffee from Jos√© at Alta Nota. A few gems from Jos√©: \\"Now smell it. It\'s paradise\\",  \\"It\'s like a poem of cacao, peach... red fruits\\". We buy beans and treats to go then wet our feet on the beach for a bit, buy a pretty ceramic cup, and stop for a bean sauce pizza topped with cochinita pibil. We get and expensive ATV ride to the port, catch the ferry back, and drive for three hours to Valladolid. Liz gets us a room in a nice hotel smack dab in the middle of the city. After a quick rest we head through the park and to a food cart that sells cochinita pibil tacos plus a torta of similar taste. From there we wander the streets for a good bit. We pass through a very posh part of town. Liz gets a little cat head ornament and I get a nice cardigan. Back to the square for a leche churro and then back for Tecate and El Camino.<br><br>Breakfast is nice coffee drinks with enfrijoladas and . From there we get the car and drive north for about half an hour to Ek Balam. It\'s a large and stunning ancient Mayan city which was, for a time, the seat of the Mayan kingdom. Part of the original plaster is preserved and it\'s magnificent. It\'s the entrance to a kings tomb and has visitors walk though the teeth lined jaws of a giant mythical beast. We drive a few minutes further onto Cenote Xcanche. We decent about four flights of stairs, following the lines of repelling tree roots down to the deep aqua pool. I have no concept of just how deep it is. There are just a few other people in the hole with us and we all find moments of silence broken only by the occasional drip. Back on the surface we dry off in awkward hammocks until they tell us it\'s time to leave. Liz\'s headache has picked up considerably and she spends the rest of the evening in bed. I explore more of the city center and feast on some delicious burritos and horchata. After picking up water and churros I kick back in the hotel, half watch I Don\'t Feel at Home in this World Anymore and work on crossstitch designs.<br><br>After taking our time and me doing a bit of work we check out and drive to Chich√©n-Itz√°. About 10 miles away we get stopped by a group of semi-official looking folks in vests who tell us we need a free special sticker to park close in and also that we should spend and extra $30 on tickets to buy from them. We take the sticker, but decline the pricey ticket. When we arrive at the site they tell us that sticker has no meaning. We park right next to the entrance. There are A LOT of vendors here. I soon get tired of smiling and nodding at folks. The ruins are amazing. The temple of K\'uk\'ulkan is mesmerizing and the ball court is majestic. Though it\'s warm out, there\'s a fair amount of shade and that allows to to take our time strolling through the surreal space. When the clouds are covering the sun, we lie down in the grass and take in the space. I\'m reminded of sitting under the Eiffel tower with Liz ten years ago. We get back on the road and, in three hours, are in Playa del Carmen. We check in and soon meet Rob & Tony. They take us across the plaza to Ay Taco for some damn good tacos, plus an el pastor quesadilla for good measure. We spend a good while strolling the seemingly endless strip before heading back to the hotel for drinks in the garden.<br><br>Across the plaza for coffee. At noon, we change hotels and I scrape the side of the car in the parking garage. From there we do a mini road trip to Puerto Morelos. We soon find a nice seafood restaurant on the beach where Cici serves us ceviche and an excellent grilled fish that a man just brought in. We stroll the beach and town for a bit until we get hot and head back to the hotel. After a nap I head to a yoga class across the plaza. We meet back up with the boys, grab some okay brats from a street stall, and then head back to the hotel pool for some wine and beer.<br><br>It\'s a late morning filled with laziness and work duties. We eventually get out for a late lunch at Mariscos y Clamatos El Doctorcito for pretty good ceviche and drinks. We make it down to the beach in time to catch another beautiful sunset. I stop by a shop and get some nice undies and then we head back to the hotel and start watching inside man. Two hours in we break to pick up a pizza and take it back to the room for the next two episodes. Out to a bar for a nightcap and then to bed.<br><br>I bring in coffe and very yummy pastries. Soon we meet up with R&T and drive south. Our first stop is the Tulum ruins, which are not as impressive looking as the other sites we\'ve visited on this trip, but are stunning as they\'re set right up against some seaside cliffs. We head into Tulum and, after much deliberation, settle on a quite good ceviche place that serves a delicious michelada. We\'re all pretty sticky and tired so, after two more unsuccessful stops, we head back to the hotel and nap. When it\'s nice and dark we meet the boys up on the rooftop for wine and snacks late into the night.<br><br>We, for the first time in this trip, wake up early enough to get the hotel breakfast. I order \\"divorced eggs\\", which are fried eggs topped with two different types of sauce. We get cleaned up, check out and attempt to buff out the scratches, without much success. We head to a restaurant a few doors down to see a drag brunch. They\'re running about 90 minutes behind, but after much anticipation we catch three ladies lip sync to a bunch of songs we don\'t know and a few we do. We then head out and hit the road back to Cancun. I do my best to cover the scratches with a bit of mud and somehow it works. As the flight attendant is doing the safety demonstration an automated voice from the seat behind me loudly states \\"Charge your phone you dumb stupid bitch\\". Everyone has a good chuckle. David picks us up, shows us some of the work being done to his ceiling and takes us to Fuel City.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"20.890824, -88.137559","From":"Dec 3, 2022","To":"Dec 11, 2022","People":"Rob & Tony","Locations":"Holbox, Valladolid, Ek Balam, Cichen-Itza, Play del Carmen, Puerto Morelos, Tulum","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/zpq93pgnwKUByKzZA"},{"City":"Cornwall","Trip":"Southern England","Id":"290","Photo":"x","Description":"We spend the night in Exeter, eat a hoisin duck wrap plus a curry chicken sandwich, watch The Lure and drink canned cocktails. Just before we would head to bed Liz discovers Better Call Saul season 6 is on Netflix here. There are 13 episodes! We watch one and head to bed.<br><br>A pretty decent full English breakfast from the Holiday Inn Express and and we head into Dartmoor National Park. Our first stop is a misty mountain dotted with grazing ponies. The beauty of the ponies, the mountain and the rolling landscape behind is surreal. Next we park by Two Bridges Hotel and hike along a river valley for about two miles to Wistman\'s Wood, a centuries-old moss-covered oak forest that feels like it would fit right into Middle Earth. Liz falls on the slippery slopey trail three times and wets her bottom. We climb the hill to see the rocky tors and happy cows. We make our way back and stop into the hotel pub for a pasty, chips, a cask ale and a cream tea, all of which are excellent. A few minutes drive west followed by a mile walk through rain and sheep and we\'re at Foggintor Quarry. It\'s deep and steep and contained and beautiful. We get cozy and each find a nice spot to take it all in for a while. After some nice pics and a rainy walk back we hit the road to Penzance. Two or so hours later we\'re here. We pop into Saintsbury\'s to stock up on more wine and chocolate. Our hotel is a charming inn right in the heart of the town. After putting our stuff down we head on a bit further to Mackerel Sky Seafood Bar for wine, scallops, mussels in cream with tarragon, smoked mackerel mac & cheese, crab nachos, samphire, potatoes and pumpkin kimchi. Back to the hotel for wine, snacks and BCS.We sleep in, drink instant coffee and hot chocolate, and then check out. We wander the high street. I buy I Will Survive on 45 from an antique shop. We get books and cards from another. I read an entire, very short, book with a delicious oat flat white at a cafe with the bathroom tap on the ceiling. A few minutes on I become entranced by a heavily-reverberated flood of plucked strings. I follow the sound to find a heavily-bearded person flat picking Irish melodies on a four-string banjo. We make our way to the stunning, sunny, surreal promenade. Two divers prepare to go under. A swimmer traverses the bay. The art deco lido anchors the waterfront. Liz finds a pub, which is a British Naval ship version of The Golden Tiki. We split whitebait plus a Proper Fish & Chips. When we arrive at St. Michael\'s Mount we discover the tide is high and the boats stop running in November so we only admire it from afar. There\'s still a good two hours of daylight so we make for St. Ives on the north coast. Cute wooden postcards. Pushing pennies. Cornish ice cream on the harbor. Dusty greens and purples fade into evening. We walk to the hill at the end of the cape and take in the lights of the town against the blackening sky. Fireworks sparkle on the horizon. We hold each other in the chilly evening air. An hour or so Londonward and we\'re at Jamaica Inn for steak and ale pie, onion rings and cask ale. We had originally planned on staying here tonight, but they\'re fully booked. I don\'t mind though because this place feels pretty touristy and it\'s the worst food we\'ve eaten in this trip. Liz instead books us a room at The Bodmin Jail Hotel. Built in the 1790\'s, it now is the site of a stunning and luxurious hotel. Our room takes up three former cells. The middle cell once held William Lightfoot, a murderer who was eventually hanged at the jail. We stay up late watching more Saul.<br><br>After a great Full English we partake in the Bodmin Jail Museum/Experience, which is a cross between a museum and a Disneyland ride entrance. Much like the hotel it is exceptionally well produced, featuring a real time shipwreck, a big scary cat, and an immersive execution. We drive north to Tintagel Castle, which has been more of a ruins than a castle for something like the last 800 years. It\'s the site of the maybe fictional King Arthur and Merlin. It\'s rainy and windy and very beautiful. Onto Boscastle only to discover that the witch museum closed for the season a few days ago. A few more minutes up the road is a bustling cafe which serves a solid cream tea. We drive east for four hours, grab a curry from Raj of India and check into a hotel by Heathrow. We eat on the bed and watch more Better Call Saul. Raj is so good. The korma is nutty and creamy while the masala has a notes of coconut and smoke.<br><br>A bit of cold curry and instant coffee before we head to the airport.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"50.117086, -5.534246","From":"Nov 2, 2022","To":"Nov 6, 2022","People":"","Locations":"London, Suffolk, Cornwall","NumberInTrip":"","One":"51.523613, -0.134659","Two":"52.401557, 1.412880","Three":"50.556063, -3.964624","Four":"50.117086, -5.534246","Five":"50.218150, -5.476553","Six":"50.474721, -4.728444","Seven":"50.666818, -4.758471","Eight":"50.694260, -4.678438","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/fPhz5fct8ykq9jMXA"},{"City":"Suffolk","Trip":"Southern England","Id":"289","Photo":"x","Description":"In 90 minutes we\'re in Whitham, Liz\'s hometown.

We walk onto Soho, which is more jam packet than I remember, and onto Palomar. Orange wine, schnitzel, kubaneh, labneh, ikura, hummus, beef tartare, enoki, chicken parts and a fried sea bream.

We\'re too tired to even go out to a cocktail bar so we head back to the hotel and sleep until 11:30 a.m.<br><br>I grab some coffee from nearby. Soon we head out to meet Irene and Juan for lunch at Rosa\'s Thai, which is quite good, especially Juan\'s fried aubergine. After a nice time chatting they walk is to King\'s Cross where we catch a train to Stevenige to meet Jessica and Nelson. We catch up for a few, greet Nelson with many treats and dine on the fantastic Sunday roast Jessica has prepared. She serves honey-glazed carrots, skin on mashed potatoes, broccoli and lamb shoulder stewed in garlic. It is killer good. We spend a good while catching up, drinking after eights and coaxing Nelson to get closer to us. Soon Roy, her dad, comes by with his two cats Monty and Floyd and we share chocolate cheesecake. They share their love of Cornwall. Time flys by and we catch a train back to the hotel. Katsu curry crisps and bed.<br><br>We sleep in again. We find out from Rob that he\'s still not feeling well and will cancel their trip. We\'re feeling so good about being here that we decide to extend our time in England and do a road trip out to the southwest tip of Britain. I pick up more coffee and at around 1 we head out. We Central line to Bond street and to The Mayfair Chippy for beautiful oysters and unquestionably the best fish and chips either of us has ever had. Absolute perfection. From there we hop across the street to Selfridges and pick up treats for friends and family. We head east and pop into a record shop for a look. Liz heads to a wine shop and I get a haircut. Next I buy a very nice and expensive coat. I walk east and stop at The Angel for a pint of cask ale. This pub is small, dark and carpeted. I love pubs like this. Liz arrives and helps me finish my drink. In a few we head across the street and meet Jessica outside Punjab. A ghoul beckons us in. We catch up some more and tell her about our new Cornwall plans, which delights her. When Bea arrives we head in and feast on curries, naan, chutneys and papadams.

We hit the road and head north. Before long we\'re in Kentucky and at Mammoth Cave. We take the Historic tour, which is a two mile, two hour tour through some very open and very closed areas of this truly mammoth cave system. Our guide is a gem, full of cave jokes and a wealth of information about the history of people in this particular hole in the ground. We pick up some tchotchkes and head back down to Nashville.

We start with a shared Sippopotamus, crab rangoon and then a second round of solo drinks. Au Cheval has quite a wait so we pop into Girl & the Goat for some more drinks first. Au Cheval is worth the wait. We get a ridiculous bone marrow on toast with beef cheek marmalade, fries with garlic aioli, hash browns with duck heart gravy, plus burgers and stouts. After there we make for Lizzie McNeill\'s to meet up with some of the wedding crew for another round. Liz has hit a wall so we call it a night and crash.<br><br>It\'s a beautiful morning and I walk into the loop for coffee at Inteligencia. On the way back I have a look at the bean. When I get back Liz is just about to leave. We do downstairs where Caryn picks her up‚Äîthey\'re heading to the rehearsal‚Äîand drops off a bottle of Texas blue corn bourbon that Liz had ordered for me as a gift. I get cleaned up and make my way to COS, where I get some nice things. I stroll through the area and try on a couple of suits at Suit Supply. Before long Liz and I are back in the room. She had picked up Taiwanese pastries for us to snack on. Kyle is nearby so we invite him up for some whiskey and mushroom jerkey. From there we head north. We find a terrace bar, but right as we are about to order Caryn texts and invites us to her parents\' place, which is only a few minutes away. We mingle with the crowd there for just a bit before we all walk down to Robert\'s for a big pizza dinner out on the patio. Just before I\'m about to take my first bite my jaw starts hurting very bad. I\'m able to chew after a few minutes, but it will be in pain for the rest of this trip. That aside, dinner is very lovely. Liz is feeling sleepy and heads home. A group of about 10 of us decides to head back to the terrace bar for a round. I get to connect with Erin, Kelly, Kyle, Emily, Henning and Fernanda. From there Kyle, Emily and I head up to the Gayborhood for some dancing late into the night.<br><br>I take my time getting up. At 1 I meet Kyle at Lou Malnati\'s where we nurse our nauseated heads with some pretty good deep dish pizza. After that I head to the Starbucks Reserve for a coffee and then head to the Sheraton lobby. The group builds and soon enough the shuttle bus comes to take us to the country club. After a slight delay on the side of the freeway for the driver to \\"re-jam\\"...something, we arrive at the castle on the golf course. The ceremony is sweet and not too long. Liz looks absolutely stunning in her green velvet dress. From there we do all of the fun wedding things and I dance our butts off. At 11:45 the bus takes us back to to the hotel downtown. Most folks head home, but Kyle and I head out for another round of dancing, follow by some late night taco bell antics. I walk home in the mostly quiet downtown.<br><br>I get coffee and cuddle with Liz for a bit before we check out and head to the park. We take in Buckingham Fountain, a Hawthorne tree grove and the bean. A very calm van driver takes us to Chinatown where we meet Andrew at Slurp Slurp. We catch up over dumplings and yummy noodle soups. The hand-shaved noodles are particularly delightful. Next we grab a boba and walk to Ping Tom Park where we sit in the shady grass on the riverbank under a willow and soak in the perfect day. On our walk back I spot a bird sitting in the middle of the sidewalk. We don\'t see anything physically wrong with him, but he seems very sleepy and let\'s Liz nudge him onto a sheet of paper. We put him under some bushes and leave him a cap of water. Into Bar 9 where we get to meet Elvis, Andrew\'s partner, and try some of his treats including mapo fries, General Tso\'s cauliflower, and ube egg tarts. We also have some nice cocktails made by Alex. Back outside we find our feathered friend has flown the coop, which is the best news we could have hoped for.

We\'ve still got a bit more time to kill so we pop into Tonga Hut for some yummy cocktails. Airport. Pizza.<br><br>We head to the Lutheran Church for Jim\'s funeral. The religious part is weird, but a few folks play touching live music and others share funny stories. We lunch at Mario\'s, an Italian-American place with an apparently killer Chinese chicken salad.

We all hang for a good couple of hours and have a very nice time. The group of us spends the rest of the evening at Mom\'s. Justin puts on a soccer game and Liz starts cleaning the kitchen sink.

We drive to Pizzana and get there a few minutes after they close, but they are super nice and still give us the pizza plus a free piece of chocolate cake. The pizza is cacio e pepe with dollops of parmeseana crema. The cake is soft and tastes of olive oil. We eat in the car and then drive to Tiki Ti. We drink some yummy, slightly divey drinks and get a cute lantern mug. We finish the pizza in the car and then head to the hotel to crash.<br><br>I sleep in a bit. When we\'re up and ready we head to Courage Bagels. We wait for at least 45 minutes, but this place is worth it. We get a half order of Running through the garden, one with cr√®me fr√¢iche and caviar, and a sandwich with sardines plus some very yummy coffees. These are the best bagels. We pop into Pygmy Hippo Shop, the LA Farmers Market and Urth Cafe for a look around. No sign of Russell. To Funnel Mill in Santa Monica for cacao nib cold brew and house chai.

Onto Cicada for Mambo Craze, a live throwback Latin Music dance party with burlesque dancers, including a cyr wheel performance by none other than Tosca. The music is grooving, the venue is a stunning deco hall, the crowd is beautiful and the performers are mesmerizing. Near midnight we walk the three minutes over to Clifton\'s, but the steep cover and club vibe turn us home instead. As we\'re walking back we pass the Cicada club again and spot none other than Tosca waiting for a cab on the street. We say hi, give our praises chat with her for a few minutes. She is goofy and down to earth and very cool. Back in room Liz puts on a cute outfit and shows it off. As I lie down for bed I get very itchy and within a couple of minutes discover I have hives all over my neck and dotted elsewhere.<br><br>We call Heather to wish her a very happy birthday. Liz reveals her secret plan, complete with reservations already made to Rolf and Daughters, to come out in a couple of weeks. We don\'t quite have time for the breakfast place Liz had planned, so we grab some buffet from downstairs and head over to Bob Baker\'s Marionette Theater for a magical hour of Mexican-inspired song and dance by an array of fascinating string-bound creatures. Just before the show starts I spot someone who looks suspiciously like Elijah Wood sitting across from us. At one point he lets out a laugh and my suspicion is confirmed. After the show I give him a quick gush of praise, which he took very kindly. Next stop is the John Soden House, a stunning FLW build. It\'s an private building, but the view from the front is enough to give us an even greater appreciation of the master of space and angles. Next we head south a bit to Holbox some delicious Mexican seafood dishes. We park the car back by the hotel and climb the hill to MOCA for some great large-scale contemporary works.

The upside is that we\'re up early and head to Courage for a second round. The bagels are pure fucking perfection. After those babies we head south for a while to Watts Towers, a series of mosaic clad structures build by an Italian immigrant over a period of thirty years. We take those in for a bit, I kiss Liz on the face and we move on. Next stop is Wayfarers chapel, a geometric seaside sacred space designed by none other than Frank Lloyd Wright. Up the coast a bit for some yummy Philz Coffee and then west to Manhattan Beach where we sit in the sand and enjoy our various food leftovers with most of a bottle of wine.

We share a sad bagel sandwich and watery cold brew. On the plane I catch up on Stranger Things. We land and get the bus to the Marriott about a mile east of the strip. They\'re still not ready for us so we hang for a few and get a ride to Carnitas Don Claudio in the way northwest. Our driver sings a bit of Zeppelin karaoke in the car for us. At Don we dine on quesabirria tacos and a carnitas burrito. They are stupid good. We next head to Charleston Antique Mall and Moondog Records for antiques and records. After that is Frankie\'s for Frankie\'s. We sip three very delicious drinks and reek of smoke by the end of it. To the hotel. Liz orders Thai from Lotus of Siam and I pop down the street to pick it up. We snack on that for a few before heading to OmegaMart. We spend almost four hours exploring the incredible space. It is very well done and the whole Area 15 compound is packed.<br><br>We take our time getting up, grab some buffet, move over to Flamingo, and walk to Akhob. Our guides are lovely and even give us a few extra minutes as they can tell we\'re really into it. The experience is serene and meditative. Each color gives me a unique feeling and plays on my eyes in different ways. We eat yummy cold curry leftovers on a mall couch then catch a ride to the Office of Collecting and Design. We spend the next 90 minutes looking through the small-ish room packed with hidden treasures, trinkets, tchotchkes, gems, doll parts, match boxes, dice, statues, bones, googley eyes, letters, miniature tools, mirrors, containers, slides, ice cream cones, Christmas trees, glasses and a whole lot more. The best part of all is Jessica, the curator and our docent who we both just absolutely hit it off with. She and Liz probably swapped 15 recommendations for museums and restaurants around the world. We head back to the Flamingo and, after a daunting line at the check-in desk, get into our room. Before long we head downstairs to meet the boys. We\'re short on time so we opt for In-N-Out and then take it up to the room to eat. For dessert we share Aperol Spritzes. Next we get real pretty and meet them again downstairs in front of RuPaul\'s Drag Race. The show is very good, though at 90 minutes, a bit on the short side. Afterward we stop by the casino bar for a couple more drinks, after which Liz and I are quite drunk. After quickly loosing a couple of rounds of Roulette it\'s 3 a.m. Dallas time and we finally call it a night.<br><br>I find this mysterious black crumbly stuff on the bed. Liz informs me that last night we got chocolate cake from the cake vending machine on our way back to the room last night and ate it in bed. Liz nurses a moderate hangover for much of the day. I pop down to Goorin and buy a nice sun hat. I attempt the pool, but the club vibe is strong and I\'m not feeling it. At 4 we meet the boys in their room for a Hypnotiq spritz. Soon we head to Golden Tiki for some yummy drinks and lots of delicious snacks. Next we head downtown and get in a quick tour of the Neon museum. It is oppressively hot. We pop down to Freemont, I investigate some fake pot, and we step in to Circa where we proceed to give them money for nothing. We pick up more of that tropical blue elixir and head back to the hotel for a another round. We call it a night at a much more reasonable 11 p.m.<br><br>After a Starbucks run we check out, look at the flamingos and then meet Rob & Tony in their room. They rented a car so we get that and head out. We try for Chilly Jilly\'s, but there\'s no indoor seating, so we opt for some decent Mexican. Our next stop is Hoover Dam. It is stunning, but we can only handle about ten minutes in the heat before we\'re all done. Back in Boulder City we stop by Milos for a bottle of wine before they drop us off at the airport.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"36.116270, -115.172290","From":"Jul 9, 2022","To":"Jul 12, 2022","People":"Rob & Tony","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/kopxgnWhqQ5PHSGc6"},{"City":"Oklahoma City","Trip":"A OK","Id":"280","Photo":"x","Description":"After work we hop on 35 and drive north for 192 miles, with a stop for a Big Mac along the way.

Our first stop out is to Coffee Slingers for a Jalapeno Business and a cold brew with coconut milk. From there we pop into a few shops. Liz picks up a Meowboys shirt and I earrings from Shop Good. As we\'re driving we pass a pretty rainbow colored building and decide to stop in. It\'s called Craig\'s Curious Emporium. It\'s sort of like a big gay Spencer\'s and a bit of a blast from the \'90s. The staff are all very lovely and give us some good recommendations. Next we stop by Fabric Factory and grab some swatches. At Dead People\'s Stuff I chat with a charming woodworker and a teenage girl compliments my outfit. To Big Truck Tacos for some very good tacos and then we check into Classen Inn Motel, which is very charming. In a few we head to RETROKC and then Trolley Stop where Liz picks out Are We Not Men. Back to the motel for a bit. I hem my trousers, we take some cute pics and then head to a Burlesque show. I\'m not so much a fan of the MCs Adele and Bryan, but there are some very good performances including a non-binary aerialist and a Mohawk burlesque artist. Next we head to the gayborhood and pop into The Boom where we catch the end of a drag show. Taco Bell for a very late dinner.<br><br>I pick up Elemental Coffee and we enjoy it with a banana walnut cardamom muffin at the motel. Next to Factory Obscura, which is pretty cool and feels a lot like Meow Wolf. We hit the road towards home, but make a pit stop in Norman at The Diner for a great burrito and a burger.

As we\'re wrapping up taking some photos of it a fun group rolls up, literally, on roller skates and they snap some sweet shots of us. As we head back into town we stop at a few other roadside attractions, including some giant giant Giant stars cutouts and a Stardust billboard. It\'s already 3 when we cruise into town and it seems things will be shutting down pretty soon, so we hit up a few main street shops before they shutter up for the night. I get a sweet vintage chore coat and a boxy tee. From there we check into El Cosmico, a motley collection for teepees, yurts, army huts, tents and vintage RVs; the last of which we have booked for the evening. We settle in and spend a good while getting cool with the help of the A/C and setting sun. In an hour or two we are feeling peckish. Not much appears to be open, but we head to Lost Horse Saloon, which seems close and cheap at least. It turns out to be both of those things as well as incredibly delicious. We get some of the best and freshest guac I\'ve had since Barrio Queen in the mid teens and savory pulled pork tacos. Mid-meal in walks some folks we sat next to at Long Draw and we chat it up with them for a bit. They encourage us to visit their tiny town outside of San Antonio, Bandera. From there we head to Marfa Open to hear some live music, but as we pull up things aren\'t really getting started yet and we\'re not in the mood for a late night, so we opt to head back to El Cosmico, take in the sunset from the hammocks and watch Giant from our private porch. When it\'s fully dark I take long-exposure photos of the teepees and stars.<br><br>I make coffee and shower on the deck before we check out. We first stop by Marfa Burrito for some especially good ones with lardy beans. Next we sit at Do Your Own Thing for some coffee and chats with our burrito neighbors. Town is pretty closed down today so we hit the road. We drive north past Fort Davis through the gorgeously phallic landscape. The man at the vintage shop yesterday recommended we stop at Balmorhea State Park for a dip in the 4x version of Barton Springs, but it\'s already full for the day so we turn east towards home.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"30.309942, -104.017721","From":"May 29, 2022","To":"May 30, 2022","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/arRUBU19Uqu5oeWL7"},{"City":"Terglingua","Trip":"Big Marfa","Id":"278","Photo":"x","Description":"After work we hit the road and drive west for six hours. At midnight we stop at a very nice Fairfield in Monahans.<br><br>Biscuits and gravy for breakfast. We grab a big cold brew and some cinnamon beginets from PJs and head south. The land starts out incredibly flat and mostly barren, but within an hour we encounter rolling hills, which climb their way up to mountains. We enter the park and make for the Fossil Discovery Exhibit. It tells of the long history of this region from being the floor of a shallow sea, to a tropical wetland, to today via the many impressive fossils that have been found in the park. It\'s only just past 11, but it is already incredibly hot outside. We can only handle being out in the covered structure for about 20 minutes. Back in the car, we head to the Rio Grande Village Nature Trail at the southeastern edge of the park. The actual trails are just too long for us to brave in this heat, but we stop for a couple of minutes at a picnic area just off the river. Someone has left out some cute copper wire figurines for sale and we pick up an ocotillo with a roadrunner next to it. It looks like there was a big fire through here recently and the whole bank area is covered in ash. It\'s a bit too steep and sandy for Liz, but I slide down the bank to get to the water. It\'s more of a stream than a river and the water is surprisingly warm in temperature. We stop at another pretty lookout spot before heading west to the hotel. In an hour we\'re at Willow House; a minimalist britalist collection of casitas outside of Terlingua. It\'s quaint and gorgeous. The room is cool and dark and smells of geranium. After saying hi to the Cuban managers in the main house we settle in for a quick lie down...an hour or so later we both have to force ourselves out of the sun induced coma we seem to have fallen into. When we get up we head to Long Draw Pizza for mozzarella sticks, pizza and beer. It\'s quaint and the pizza is good as heck. Back to the hotel for some pretty pictures in the golden hour and then some wine. When the sky is turning dark we head back outside and lie on a big hanging bed and watch the stars come out.<br><br>We get up moderately early, make some sandwiches and hit the road. We make for the Chiso Basin Visitors Center and before long are winding our way around the Loop. We don\'t make the full loop as Liz is already turning quite red, but we get plenty of great sights including some deer, big stink bugs, a snek and a whole ton of beautiful plants and mountains. We take her back to the car and then I head back out to do the Window Loop Trail. On my way I chat a bit with some very lovely Rangers. I like Rangers. After the short, but photogenic, loop we drive a few more and head to the Lost Mine Trail. We start it together, though after about 15 minutes Liz is turning red again and decides to head back. I go on for another 15 or so until I am able to straddle the ridge. Back down I see that she is already battling an oncoming migraine. She lies down while I drive us the hour or so to Santa Elena Canyon. She, unfortunately, is still feeling pretty rough and decides it\'s best to stay in the car. I make my way down to the extrememly dry and cracked riverbed and take in the absolutely awe-inspiring views. I hike about 10 minutes into the ominous canyon before turning back. We\'re both hot and tired and it\'s well into the day now so we decide to head back. We both nap for a bit and, once we\'re getting good and hungry, I head back to Long Draw to pick up another delicious pizza, this time with some cheesy bread sticks. We monch and then sit out back to watch the sun set while drinking the pinot noir we picked up in Portland. It is very dang good. Once it gets dark we head back in an put on a couple episodes of Better Call Saul. After a good touch we fall immediately asleep. I had set an alarm for 3 a.m. to hopefully catch the Milky Way, but it\'s too hazy out so back to bed.<br><br>We get dolled up real cute and take some nice photos before checking out. We hit the road north and then west towards Marfa.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"29.268675, -103.303370","From":"May 26, 2022","To":"May 29, 2022","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/arRUBU19Uqu5oeWL7"},{"City":"Nashville","Trip":"Seats","Id":"277","Photo":"x","Description":"We hit the road after work on Friday.

We catch up in the room for just a few before getting a ride to Lao Peng You, a Chinese restaurant Liz doesn\'t remember how she found. The place is charming and our server is a gem. The food is all stupid good. Silky tofu in chili oil and vinegar, chilled eggplant, Dan Dan noodles, beef dumpling soup, Taiwanese beef noodles. We are all very happy. We pop into the Ukrainian  The weather is perfect so we decide to stroll a while. I talk with mom on the phone for a few and somehow fall down. Ben shows us a shit fountain. Liz spots a Philz Coffee, so we see stop in for a couple of mojito drinks. Our timing is great and we have a great view of the rainstorm that passes by. Now we\'re in Wicker Park and we make our way down the street. They show us the Wicker Park Scramble before taking us up to the 606, which is basically a copy of the High Line in Nee York. There are flowers everywhere. The tulips and pear trees are especially happy right now. We loop back down and pop into Royal Palms, a shuffle board bar designed to feel like an Olympic swimming pool. We do cocktails, prom selfies, a ring swing game, and connect four. Back down the road to Big Star for Mexican. We all catch the blue line downtown and part ways. They are great and we\'re happy to have been able to spend this time together. In discussion our appreciation for them, Liz gives some apt adjectives. Ben: measured & playful. Kaori: sassy & electric. Back to the hotel for a quick change and then we catch the pink line to...<span class=\\"list__container menu\\"><span class=\\"list__title\\">Aviary</span><span class=\\"list__item\\">I\'m Blue: Lemon, blueberry, coconut chai, port and gin with a caviar and cucumber slushie oyster</span><span class=\\"list__item\\">Zombie Panda: lychee, pisco, raspberry liqueur ice balls with corn fritters</span><span class=\\"list__item\\">Banana, curry and gin with mushroom soup and cheesy bread</span><span class=\\"list__item\\">Torched Campari over rye, apple brandy, apricot liqueur, Averna, bitters with duck confit, celeriac, grape and mustard</span><span class=\\"list__item\\">Truffle explosion.

Around noon we get a bus to meet Ben and Kaori at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder. Most of the staff seems to be in a pretty bad mood, but our server has enough charisma to counter it. He recommends the Mediterranean Bread, which is a big NY pizza dough covered in butter and herbs. We each also get a pizza pot pie, which I a pizza made inverted in a bowl with the crust on top and then flipped back over when served. It is pretty darn good and has a whole lot of cheese. From there we walk east to the Lincoln Park zoo where we say hi to the seals, snow leopards and a few types of primate including a troop of gorillas. The snow leopards are particularly majestic. We say goodbye to some sweet humans and make our way first to the hotel to get our bags and then to the airport. We don\'t make our first flight so we hang in the lounge for a bit and chat with Natalie, who is coming back from Paris.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"41.913081 -87.681862","From":"Apr 29, 2022","To":"May 1, 2022","People":"Ben & Kaori, Caryn & Brent","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/XVoiuA92NBsphS6Z9"},{"City":"Bentonville","Trip":"Pleasant Surprise","Id":"275","Photo":"x","Description":"I make a coconut maple cold brew with almond butter toast and then we get on a plane to Arkansas. I get about 30 minutes into Spiderman: No Way Home and I really like it so far. Avis upgrades us to a fancy Chrysler and we drive into down. We aim for Onyx Coffee Lab, which is located right in the historic downtown. We, very fortuitously, arrive right in the middle of the first Bentonville Farmer\'s Market of the year. The weather is gorgeous and there\'s a wonderfully diverse crowd. I pick up a nice plate, which I intend to use for guitar picks and such. Into Onyx where we pick up some beautiful weird coffee drinks plus a breakfast sandwich and a toasted pimento cheese sandwich with tomato jam. We pop into Block Street Records where I pick up a Bronski Beat LP. Next we head to Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Our first stop on site is Frank Lloyd Wright\'s Bachman-Wilson House. It is the work of a master of space, shapes, lines and materials. On the art walk we take in Kusama Narcissus Balls, a Bourgeois spider and a Turrell Skyspace. Inside the museum for early American art, light-inspired works, modern, contemporary, and loads of very good art. We spend over two hours taking it all in. I pop into Sally for a quick store visit and then we head to the hotel for a quick lie down before making our way to dinner at Preacher\'s Son. Beets with ricotta. Kale Caesar. Oysters with mingionette. Burrata on brioche with fig compote and pine nut butter. Roasted cauliflower with whipped cheddar, cashew and benne seed. We walk downstairs for the tiki popup at Undercroft. It takes them a good while to get us a menu and then another good while to come back and take our order. The drinks are just okay, but we have a nice chat.

We work for a bit from the airport and then Heather picks us up and takes us back to her place. We give Frodo some smooches and do our occupation. Soon Heather makes us some killer kimchi quesidillas with her homemade kimchi and the tortillas we brought for her. When work is done we celebrate first with a spicy tepache kombucha. Soon we\'re working on some great and funky pet nats. For dinner Heather decided to make the tomahawk steak she got from a local farmer. While we\'re waiting she makes some stupidly good asparagus. She slow roasts and reverse sears the meat. For sides she does mashed potatoes and parsnip plus crispy Brussels Sprouts. It is the No 1 steak in heaven. I\'m so glad we are able to eat her cooking. She\'s really good at it. Dessert is Braulio floats.<br><br>Most of today is uneventful as we work. For lunch I ride Heather\'s bike to Joyland and pick up excellent burgers plus a chocolate malt shake. At the end of that time Heather gets home and we all get pretty and green.

I arrive at 9 they have a dinner of Bangers and Mash with Guinness ready for me.<br><br>I work in the morning while Justin gets supplies ready. At around 2 we head West. Inks Lake Park is only a little over an hour away, deep in the hill country. We get to our spot and get set up. We set up the tent, two hammocks, some chairs, tables, and the grill. It feels pretty good. After testing out the hammocks for a bit we do a short hike to Devil\'s Waterhole. The weather is great. Back at the camp we play Frisbee for a bit and then get started on our dinner of hot dogs and beans. We eat just as the sun is setting and it\'s very beautiful. There\'s a fire ban due to the high winds and it\'s getting cold quickly so we clean up and head in the tent for a few rounds of Scattegories. We brave the cold to fire up the grill and make s\'mores and a toasted Twinkie before calling it a night.<br><br>We wake up at around 9. It\'s chilly out, but the sun feels good. Justin makes some strong coffee and we sit in the sun for a bit to wake up and warm up. Next he makes pancakes and then we get cleaned up. We decide to do a combo hike of the Fisherman\'s Trails plus the Lakes Trail. It\'s a little over two miles total. It\'s quite pretty though, while the hiking isn\'t challenging, the sun quickly builds in its intensity and we\'re all feeling pretty toasty. Back at the car we\'re feeling thirsty and hungry sl we head back into Burnet to pick up salads from HEB. We sack on those back at the site and relax in the hammocks for a bit. I teach Nixon how to play Azul an he kicks my butt. After another round of Frisbee we cook up some very yummy chicken fajitas that Danielle prepped for us. Then a quick clean up and we head just a bit down the road to where Justin booked us a \\"Full Moon Hike\\" with a local park ranger. While there (spoiler) was no full moon on the hike, Jaime did take us on a very informative and beautiful tour of the Pacan Flat loop. We caught sunset right at the peak, had a meditation during dusk, and used our UV lights to spot quite a few scorpions and centipedes. Tonight is much warmer than last night and it\'s very pleasant to be out after dark. We can see many stars in the sky. Back at camp we sip bourbon and make a couple of rounds of s\'mores before heading to bed.<br><br>We all wake up around 8. After some coffee we decided to try our luck on the kayaks. We get on and paddle over to the Devil\'s Waterhole, which is nice and quaint. We spot a few geese and turtles along the way. Heading back, we encounter a few geese who seem to be in some type of argument. Once back, we fire up the grills for make more coffee plus scrambled eggs, breakfast sausages, and home fries. We\'re cutting it pretty close to checkout time so we quickly load the car and head back to Round Rock.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"30.737268, -98.369057","From":"Mar 17, 2022","To":"Mar 20, 2022","People":"The Plunkett Family","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/so35xAUH6e6AdDDD7"},{"City":"Portland","Trip":"Le Spark Booth","Id":"272","Photo":"x","Description":"Flights are already packed.

It\'s super packed, but we manage to get seated pretty quickly. We get one big creamy guava baby and a spicy cold brew boy. We split one more sasparilla guy and walk around in the cold for a bit before catching a ride to Alibi. I am immediately reminded very much of Frankie\'s. It is divey, the booths are rounded with red vinyl, and there\'s karaoke going on in the back room. Liz snags a table. I put our names on the list and order a Banana Hammock, a Jungle Bird and an order of Crab Rangoon. The drinks taste as I expected, which is not as good as Frankie\'s. We hang around and play some Sqardle. We don\'t get called up to sing.<br><br>We wake up late and head to Heart. On our way there we pass a man standing bent over with needles at his feet. The coffees and cardamom bun are pretty good, but no La Cabre. To Whole Foods for garlic sauce and then to World Foods for some pretty local wines. Back to the hotel to drop stuff off and take a COVID test before getting a ride to Devil-ish Little Things Museum. Marion and her two dogs give us a detailed tour of this playful, devilish little wonderland, which features cigar holders, lighters, inkwells, tobacco holders, ashtrays, German wool stitchings, homemade ceramics, gambling paraphernalia, Christmas ornaments, paper mache masks, drinkware, erotic art, books, beadwork, a tiki bar, and many other objects featuring devils, deamons, Krampuses along with other hooved & horned creatures. We stop downtown to pop into Cargo where we pick up a paper mache kitsune mask for Marlow before heading to Bethany to visit with the Booths. Marlow meows and Jolene warms my lap while we sit out back, enjoy some Japanese pastries plus Ryan\'s homemade coconut cream cake and share our news and ideas. Marlow shows Liz the sprouts coming up through the soil. Soon they take us on a walk where Marlow picks flowers for Liz and they then give us a tour of the home.

Starbucks for some of that. At 11 we head to Never for a licorice oat latte and a yuzu coconut latte, both of which are very yummy. We then grab a couple slices of Sizzle Pie to go and head back to the room for that with the rest of the wine and sushi from last night. Halfway through the show last night we decided we want to see Sparks again so we chat with Heather and plan a trip to Nashville for next Tuesday to catch a show with her. After work I pick up some belts and underwear before we catch a bus to Matt\'s BBQ Tacos. We have an elevated Taco Bell taco supreme and it is truly supreme. Also there\'s a yummy pork taco plus queso and beans. We run in the rain to catch a bus and then another bus and, in a few more hours, are in Seattle. At the airport curb a man literally runs up to us, shows us a wad of bills in his hand, and asks if we are getting a ride into the city. After we inform him we\'re heading into, not out of, the airport. He then runs out to the street, cussing loudly about $10,000 and waves his wad of cash at cars passing by. In the airport we eat a free (thanks to Priority Pass) Caesar salad with really good smoked chicken and a bad piece of apple pie because it\'s Pi day.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"45.522777, -122.684889","From":"Mar 12, 2022","To":"Mar 14, 2022","People":"The Booth Family","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/pPu3FG8nnd55kAvQ7"},{"City":"New York","Trip":"The Beautiful People","Id":"271","Photo":"x","Description":"We land at LaGuardia. It\'s almost midnight when we catch a ride to Washington Heights. Sean, Cori and Irma meet us downstairs. We hug and smell each other. Though it\'s already late we stay up for probably an hour an a half chatting about family, animals, speakers, plants, assertive old men in Washington Heights, and chocolate.<br><br>Irma is sweet and very cuddly with me. Sean first makes some pretty okay coffee and then makes some incredibly good coffee. Cori heads into the back room as she is working today. Liz has a migraine coming on so we give her some meds and then Sean and I head to The Uptown Garrison for a cardamom orange zest latte and chicken nuggets & waffles. Before long Liz is feeling mostly better. Soon the three of us catch a train to the upper Upper West Side and head to Absolute Bagels. My bagel is an everything with cream cheese that is crispy, chewy, a little bready and not too puffy with gloopy, creamy cheese. Liz\'s nova sandwich on everything is so good that she does a very rare thing and asks to have more than her standard 50% split. She is glowing. Another train takes us to Union Station. I buy a ramps and a dandelion kimchi at the farmer\'s market. Whole Foods for coconut water. We pass by Joe\'s Pizza, which Sean says is one of his favorite slices in town, so we pop in and split a triangle of cheese three ways. A few minutes southeast is La Cabra where Ian serves us cold brew and a selection of pastries: cardamom bun, rye tart, orange marmalade & chocolate ganache donut and a chocolate mousse. We talk about family politics and politics. Sean takes us to his office for a pee. A bit further on we pop into Stick With Me for pretty treats. Just around the corner is Mother\'s Ruin so we sit down for some very drinkable cocktails. Cori shows up and gets a drink before we head to Joe\'s Shanghai in The Bowery. We have to stand out in the cold for not too awful long before sitting down for all around fabulous soup dumplings, General Tso\'s chicken, Szechuan beef, and crispy duck. They bring us sliced oranges with the check. We walk into Soho and pick up some desserts from Little Cupcake Bakery. The woman sitting across from us on the train lights up a cigarette. Back at the apartment we eat yummy strawberry cake and banana loaf.<br><br>Sean makes us very nice coffee from the beans he bought yesterday. Cori makes a big beautiful Dutch Baby with fried eggs and turkey bacon. Sean tells us about his private geometry. We take the train downtown, stop by Blank Street for for a cheese amann and coffee. Onto the Whitney Museum for the 5th floor craft exhibit. Armando gives us a wildly entertaining and informative tour of some of his favorite pieces in the gallery. A highlight is the life-size kitchen entirely encrusted in glass beads by Liza Lou. It is beautiful and powerful. I take some nice photos of Sean against the backdrop of the city and then we head up to Women and Abstraction, which features some very lovely works including a single curvy line, which the four of us especially appreciate. We grab another slice of Joe\'s, catch a train back home, get pretty and then head for dinner at Honey Badger. The neighborhood is not particularly nice, the restaurant is completely empty and we are sat in slightly chilly cabin on the street. These three factors (plus the fact we\'ve already paid for a fixed menu) inspire in me a flicker of worry that maybe we\'ve made a very expensive mistake.<span class=\\"list__container menu\\"><span class=\\"list__title\\">Honey Badger</span><span class=\\"list__item\\">A woman wearing a baggy pink sweater and jeans sets down a small plate on which lays a flower, a bit of cheese shaped like an acorn and something that looks like an elongated unripe cherry.

Soon my entire mouth is vibrating. It is intense, though not painful like spicy food. Pop Rocks is a clumsy travesty. Tongue, roof, and cheeks abuzz. Every cell oscillating. Moth agape. Eyes wide. Baffled. Salivating profusely. Our server sets down a deep-pink foamy coupe of hibiscus with Appalachian herbs. It cools and brightens the earthy hum in a way which communicates these people are masters of an unknown craft and that we are in for a wild fucking ride. Next we have the vegan acorn cheese, which is like a funky chunky smoked Gouda. Last is Imagined Fruit made from cashew. It\'s nutty and lightly sweet, slightly sour.

Throughout and after the meal we spend time chatting with Fiola, who owns the restaurant with her husband. She tells us about growing up in Kosovo during the war, making pasta during the pandemic for the many elderly residents of her neighborhood, her journey through veganism to foraging, her daughter who designed the cabins and counter, and making the 600 tiles which adorn the restaurant. She is charming and has a magical presence. We happy. It\'s after midnight and Cori gets us a car home.<br><br>Sean makes different coffee recipe with the same beans. It\'s very good and quite different from yesterday\'s cup. Downtown. No luck at Clinton St Baking Co. Hanoi House has an hour wait so we put out names on the list. We stop by Electric Burrito and the four of us share a California. Just as we get to La Cabra Hanoi House texts to let us know our table is ready. We run over, sit down and order meringuey egg coffee, spicy fishy garlic cauliflower, filet mignon pho with crispy bread sticks, b√°nh m√¨ and shaking beef, which gooey tender and crispy steak cubes that remind me a bit of the General Tso\'s Chicken from last night. Liz has a mind to pop into Astor Place with hopes of finding a skin-contact wine Ryan recently recommended, The Marigny. We pick up three bottles of that plus some orange wines and a Barbera. A bit further on we stop by Goods for the Study and pick up some very lovely stationery. Our last stop before heading back to the apartment is Whole Foods for ice cream. At the house we relax for the evening with pizza delivery, orange wine, Dandelion brownies, Malai & Jeni\'s ice cream and lots of good conversation. We share three good things and head off to sleep.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"40.851685, -73.941447","From":"Feb 17, 2022","To":"Feb 21, 2022","People":"Sean & Cori","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/UkJwXj1KDJHUNdEm6"},{"City":"Los Angeles","Trip":"Dita Von Bagels","Id":"270","Photo":"x","Description":"We land, pick up Belle\'s Bagels and check into the Westin in Downtown LA.

Holy hell these are good bagels. The Loxsmith rivals Courage, which I thought was untouchable. A bit more lie down. And more. I\'m the evening we head through Skid Row to the Arts District Brewing Co. We arrive, but they are having a private event party for Bengals fans. Liz discovers there is a Death & Co about two minutes away though so we walk over and nab a couple of cocktails. Dr Jones has carrot eau de vie and, macadamia nut and a killer texture. Clampdown is a yummy spicy banana daiquiri. We catch a ride to Venice for dinner at Felix Trattoria. They bring a nice rum & nutmeg drink on the house. Shrimp with pesto. A loaf of focaccia. Raddicio salad with anchovy dressing and bread crumbs. Ricotta stuffed fried squash blossom. A nice classy of white wine with notes of wax and green almond skins. Orcchiette with sausage, broccoli greens, peperoncino, tomato and canestrato. Linguine al limone with peperoncino and pecorino. We get a ride to Spare Lane at the Roosevelt Hotel. They let us in, but the place is packed and has more of a club vibe, so we opt to call it a night.<br><br>I rub Liz\'s legs on the couch as we play Wordle, talk food and watch the sun climb in the sky. Downstairs for a hotel breakfast and then to the pool for a dip. We head to Courage. Our server is super nice. A man sitting behind us is really bugging me so we switch tables and are then better able to enjoy these absolutely insane bagels. We get the garden veggie again and also the ikura bagel, which is just incredible. That nice server I mentioned hooks us up with 15 freebie bagels. Next we head to The Broad, a modern art museum. The highlights are a Kusama Infinity Room and the robust Lichtenstein collection. From there we walk down the hill to the Los Angeles Central Library, whose Free Mason-esque architecture caught our eye yesterday. The central tower is pretty and there\'s an exhibition on a traveling marionette group from the \'20s. Back for a bit of a nap and then out to Major Domo for good wine, fried cauliflower with fish sauce, charred cabbage with XO, a yummy wagyu steak, and a Paris-Brest with banana. Major Domo. Pacific Seas is closed so we walk back to the hotel and watch Titane.<br><br>We work from the hotel. Lunch is Konbi for eggplant katsu sandwich, egg salad sandwich, yuba salad, snap pea salad, kinako latte, banana soda, nori croissant, and a puffed buckwheat flan. I get off, hop on a scooter over to COS, buy some nice clothes, head back and check out of the room. We get a ride to a very depressing Skid Row over to Art District Brewing Company where we wear red (taken) stickers, have some good beers & nachos, watch 10 Things I Hate About You, take a silly photo booth strip, and play a bunch of free skeeball. Next we go to Sonoratown for a chew-stoppingly good steak burrito plus a very nice b&c burrito and chorizo taco. We then walk to the Orpheum Theater for the reason we came to LA. The show is incredible and everyone, including the crowd, looks amazing. Dita starts with the birdcage routine (that ends in a very sexy shower). The host makes a lot of gay jokes. Dirty Martini is a hoot. Zoro is good. Valentina is pretty. One guy dances inside a heart. One woman does an incredible ballet routine. Just after her another woman does mindblowing dancing inside of a large metal hoop. Dita does a very good red shopping Valentine\'s esque number. A very fit and acrobatic man does amazing things on a metal pole. Dita dances with a star. Though there are still a good number of acts left, we have to leave early to make sure we don\'t miss our flight back. Our driver is good (rare here) and very fast!","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"34.042760, -118.255420","From":"Feb 12, 2022","To":"Feb 14, 2022","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/xfY8SvJhZpWC8QAk8"},{"City":"Austin","Trip":"Tiki Tatsuya","Id":"269","Photo":"x","Description":"Veracruz for tacos, including an especially good bean, mushroom and potato baby.

It was meant to be a quick stop before hitting the road again, but the weather is gorgeous and we\'re enjoying the chat with her so much that we stay for nearly two hours. We hit the road.

Heather picks us up and drives us to her place where we give Frodo butt pats, drink yummy N/A wine from Acid League and chat until 2.<br><br>Her oven is broken so she microwaves water to make us Chemex. Our first stop is Proper Bagels in Belmont for coffee & bagel sandwiches. Its quite cold outside and we have to wait a while since they stopped making eggs for a bit. In time we get some yummy food including a lox bagel, a sausage egg & cheese, and a ham egg & cheese with hash brown. We make for a movie theater as we have tickets for The Tragedy of Macbeth. Hot darn it\'s something else. I\'ve never seen a movie that looks like this. The surreal sets give me Fritz Lang vibes. The world feels massive and claustrophobic at the same time. The witch, Stephen Root, and the leads are very on point. We stop by the liquor store and then head to Third Man Records, a record store selling only releases from the eponymous label, which is owned by Jack White. I pick up a live blues record plus some 45s. There is a booth from the 40s which allows you to record a 150 second clip directly onto a 7\\" disc. The three of us cram in and have a nice little chat. Back to the house for negronis and a happy Frodo. Before long we head out to Chauhan for artichoke pakora, whipped paneer, goan mussels, naan, red snapper moilee curry and a lamb lollipop korma. Back home for records, a negroni and boulevardiers.<br><br>Coffee at home before we head to Barista Parlor. They don\'t have donuts today, but we get a weird CBD cold brew. Our fall back is to head to Joyland for a fried chicken biscuit with honey hot sauce, a sausage biscuit sandwich, fries, a chocolate malt shake, and a fucking incredible burger. None of us seem to mind not having donuts. Heather drives us north to the antique district. At the first shop we focus on vinyl. I find Adam Ant and Heather some thick Bootsy Collins. In the next ship Liz picks out a Christmas ornament from the USSR. It\'s a peasant figure, which was a common theme at the time along with airships. We\'ve now not eaten for a few hours, which it means we get to eat again. Heather takes us to Chopper, a robot tiki bar with a taco truck parked out front. We start with the stupidest quesabirria tacos with consomme. I can\'t even wrap my head around how intense the flavor is. The consomme must just be pure jello at room temp. One taco is plenty to hold me over. From the bar we get a couple rounds of nice tiki drinks. The highlights are the clarified milk punch, the frozen Painkiller, and something with Yellow Chartreuse, akavit and gin. Liz buys a mug of the devil with a roller coaster running into his mouth. Back to the house for Bootsy, bulges and bubbles. Liz and I decide to catalog Heather\'s record collection. Before long we get pretty.

It\'s very late and we\'re all feeling peckish so we stop for McDonald\'s before heading to bed.<br><br>We take our time getting up before hopping on the train to Beauties. We\'re short on time before our lunch reservation, so we just grab a lox bagel sandwich and eat it on the street.

A cute little dog comes up to our table to say hi. At Arthur\'s we share pancakes, beef bacon, spicy fried chicken with maple syrup, latkas, challah, a chicken schnitzel sandwich, and a Caesar (Bloody Mary) topped with a mini lox bagel sandwich. It snowed beautifully while we were eating and now the streets are quiet and covered in white. We stop by a market to pick up some wine and head back to the hotel for a bit to nap.

I eat a spicy shrimp dish, finish The Sparks Brothers, and play a lot of Breath of the Wild. We land, get a Soul, and head tj the condo to meet the gang; Anne, Richard, Gene, and Tina. They have been here for a while on holiday. When we were planning out trip out we decided to stay here with them. We start the good times off with a yummy coconut rum and passion fruit libation. There\'s still a few hours before dinner, so we head out to a nearby beach which is known to have good coral. We get suited up and jump in. We immediately see loads of fish of all sorts of colors and beautiful coral formations, which house both black and red pencil sea urchin. We only do about 20 or so minutes in the water before getting out to dry off and head back. Back at the condo everyone showers and celebrates with another drink before making out way to Papa Kona, an American food restaurant in Downtown Kona which features a live 2-piece music set. They do top 40 covers and the woman has a nice voice. Though the food is unremarkable the company is lovely. I am surprised at how westernized everything is here. I don\'t know that I saw a single native Hawaiian person all day. It feels more like visiting a tropical version of Southern California than a Polynesian island. It\'s about 3am Dallas time when we get home from dinner so we all head pretty much straight to bed.<br><br>I wake up at 5 and play some Zelda for a bit. Once everyone is up we all sit out on the patio and have coffee with the Kirkland version of Bailey\'s. The condo overlooks a forested area which sounds and looks like it\'s teeming with wildlife. I see quite a few birds, which I can identify as birds. A mongoose runs into the forest. Gene tells me that mongooses we\'re brought to the island to eat the rats, which were feeding on the sugarcane. Unfortunately, they didn\'t help much with the rats, but did significantly hurt local bird populations. We all pack up for s day at the beach. Tina makes us wraps with chicken, cucumber, and Branson Pickle. We drive north for about 50 minutes through a black lava lunar landscape before arriving at this isolated oasis of green, which they call \'A Beach\'. I pretty quickly hop in the water with a snorkel mask and explore the reef. The water is quite choppy and murky today, but I am able to still see a good variety of colorful babes. Before long I find myself next to a sea turtle whose shell is roughly the size of a Thanksgiving turkey serving dish. We both float casually and inspect one another for a couple of minutes before parting on good terms. A little further on I find a bright orange bit of live Coral which houses a large family of black and white clown fish. As I swim up they quickly hide away in the brain-like structure, but soon make their way cautiously back out to resume their business of whatever it was they were doing before. I get out, head back, and swap the snorkel for the inflatable paddle board. I do a quick test run and see a group of turtles from above. Because the wind is so strong I can really only paddle in one direction. I land and decide to go further out this time and with Liz. I paddle her around like a gondolier and it is very nice. After some hammock relaxing we pack up and start to head back. As we\'re walking back to the parking lot Tina points out a cat sanctuary in a large tree/cave area. We see quite a few cats and make friends. Back to the condo for a quick clean up (and cocktail) before walking to Don the Beachcomber, a very pretty tiki-esque hotel bar. Drinks are Mai Tais and Lava Flows. For food we all share plates of coconut shrimp, poke nachos, regular nachos, buffalo fries, pork tacos, and calamari. It\'s is all very yummy and we are treated with a pretty nice sunset too. Back and immediately to bed.<br><br>More Bailey\'s coffee. Tina makes us banana pancakes. We don\'t have plans for today, but Tina convinces us to make the trek to the Volcano park. It\'s a lot of driving and not much extra time so we head out pretty quickly. We first make for the southern most point of the US. There\'s a fair crowd out there. The cliffs are quite pretty and the water is crystal clear. There are a few wooden platforms overlooking the water. These are used for cliff diving. About 20 meters back from the cliff is a hole in the ground leading to a beautiful, rough water chamber. We drive on s bit to visit the southern most bakery in the US. We get a chocolate custard doughnut and a lily koi doughnut. They are both very good with a firm crust and chewy dough. Onward to the volcano park. We first do a point on the north rim of the caldera, which has some pretty views of bright yellow sulfur vents. We drive east and south, then take a mile hike to another viewing platform. From here we can see lava spewing up from a pit in the ground. It is pretty awesome to see. We find out our flight will be delayed a few hours. Just a minute up the road we stop by the lava tube, which is essentially a 1/4 mile-long underground tube. It\'s pretty cool, but the real treat is the rain forest hike to it. We pick up some Maui onion chips and water from a general store and hit the road back to Kona. This time we take the saddle road that cuts across the center of the island. About two hours later we are at Umeke, a seafood restaurant which specializes in poke. We get Hawaiian oysters Rockefeller, poke with rice & kimchi cucumber, and poke nachos, which are even better than last night\'s nachos. It is very good and very filling. We make back to the condo where we get to sneak in a few games of sequence before taking ourselves plus Anne and Richard to the airport. We sleep the whole flight then go straight to work.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"19.625436 -155.984434","From":"Nov 5, 2021","To":"Nov 8, 2021","People":"Anne, Richard, Gene, Tina","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"19.914197 -155.887339","Two":"19.625436 -155.984434","Three":"18.910416 -155.680801","Four":"19.401776 -155.265570","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/879D3ydwkV76nuBCA"},{"City":"Napa","Trip":"Jessica Wedding","Id":"265","Photo":"","Description":"I didn\'t take notes for this trip, but on Friday we saw Slow Gherkin in San Francisco, on Saturday we attended Jessica & Drew\'s wedding in Napa, and on Sunday we ate at French Laundry.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"38.404403 -122.364979","From":"Aug 24, 2018","To":"Aug 26, 2018","People":"Jessica, Drew, Millers","Locations":"San Francisco, Napa","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"San Francisco","Trip":"Jessica Wedding","Id":"264","Photo":"x","Description":"To the fancy hotel where we brush our teeth.

It is quite charming and the drinks are all very good. Straight to the reception from there where we catch up with Uncle Michael and Nancy, Justin, Jake, and about 150 of Mom & Jim\'s closest friends.

Mom bought us tickets to a special tour of the Frey House II, so we head out for that. It\'s a small, minimalist, yet absolutely beautiful home of the architect Albert Frey. I knew nothing of him coming in, but learn that he had an incredible talent for designing very iconic buildings which were very pragmatic and fitted to their environment. After about 40 minutes of exploring the 800 sq foot home nestled just up the mountain and learning loads about the fascinating man from some very informative docents, we head back down to the Palm Springs Art Museum. Free entry was included with our tour so we take in the modest, yet very charming space. We are especially enthralled by the native landscape works and by the glass exhibition. We head down the street to the Architecture wing of the museum, which is featuring an exhibition chair design. There are some real beauties. Next stop is Bootlegger, where our bartender makes us some delicious concoctions as well as offering fun conversation. It\'s getting late so we start to head back, but not before grabbing some Del Taco, which hits the spot.<br><br>We work most of the day from the kitchen.

Our driver gives us the scoop on some good local foods to try, like rajas poblanos, sauteed poblanos with onions and crema. We get in and meet Greg, Andrew, and Veritay. Our room isn\'t ready yet so we wander the grounds for a bit. After walking right by a peacock we spot a cute little mix between a cat and a racoon, which is called a Coati. Within minutes we see many more. We stop into the lunch buffet for some yummy Mexican including rajas poblanas, which is really good. We check into the room and cool down for a bit. At around 7 we get dressed for the white party and head out. We immediately bump into Evelyn and Greg and find that the plans have changed. We walk instead to dinner where we dine on Mediterranean with the Three C\'s, Caitlyn, Christina, and Carrie. From there we all migrate to the lounge bar, where we mingle with April, Rose, Angela, Adrianne, Jason, Haxter. After some snacks from the cafe we head to bed.<br><br>Liz isn\'t feeling 100% so I head out on my own for a bit. I immediately bump into Rose and we chat for a few. Though the resort is a good size, it seems that every time I walk out the door I bump into someone I know. I head a few minutes south to the beach. As I pass over the mangrove boardwalk I see dozens of coati running around. Many of them are quite young and they all are adorable. I get a drink and a chair before settling in for a bit. After some light reading I hop in the warm blue-green water and play with the waves. I chat with the Three C\'s for a bit and also catch up with April and Angela. The three of us meet Liz for lunch at the same buffet as yesterday. From there, Liz and I check out the beach and the secret pool for a bit before heading back to the room to get cleaned up for the wedding. Once we\'re looking spiffy we head back to the beach for the ceremony. The weather is perfect and the sun is low in the sky. It is a very beautiful ceremony. Just as they are able to walk back down the isle as husband and wife I hear a live mariachi band strike up just behind me. Next thing I know the air is filled with bubbles. It is a wonderland. We all drink bubbles and take photos on the beach in the sunset light. When the sun goes down we migrate to the convention center for the reception. Drinks, dinner, dancing, photo booth. We sit with Andrew, Veritay, Adrianne, Jason, and Franz. Jason gives us a homemade treat for later. Evelyn straps a GoPro to a bottle of tequila, stands up on a chair, and pours it into the mouths of many of the guests. We dance so good. I haven\'t danced this much or this hard in years and it feels so good. Back to the lounge bar for more drinks and good times. They head to the beach, but I\'m wiped and call it.<br><br>First we head to the convention center to get our covid tests. To the breakfast buffet where we munch on chiliques, tacos, and more goodies. From there we book a tour of Tulum which includes visits to archeological sites and a visit to a cenote (sinkhole pool). We catch up with Adrianne and Jason for a bit longer and head back to the room. We snack on some treats and watch Night of the Teese, a burlesque spectacle. Over to the beach we find some nice chairs and fall in love with the fractal clouds. My filters are off. I\'m feeling the breeze, the birds, the water, the sounds, my gums, my stomach, my eyelids. When I\'m ready I wade into the choppy water and dance ballet with the waves. Three C\'s let us know that the slides will be closing soon so we head over there to have a few more wild rides. A good bit of the wedding crew is there and are cheering people on as they scream and shout their way down the chutes. Once last call is over we head to the pool bar. Evelyn hands us a GoPro and asks us to film ourselves jumping into the pool. I hold the camera while Liz and I jump in together. Immediately after she gently informs me that she just ripped off her big toe nail. She doesn\'t want to cause a scene and ruin the good vibes so we quietly get out and sit her down. It\'s pretty rough looking and apparent that she needs medical attention. I ask the staff for some assistance. Before long we are at the on-site medical clinic with a nurse. She is telling us that the nail needs to come off, but that she doesn\'t have the tools to do it. She recommends getting a taxi to Playa del Carmen and finding a clinic to do it. Liz wants to just wait until we are back in the US to have the procedure done, which is two days from now. The nurse implies that is not a good idea. After a bit of discussion we decide to cut our trip early and fly back first thing tomorrow morning to get it cared for. The nurse bandages her up and doesn\'t charge us, which is incredibly kind of her. We head back to the room for a bit to process everything that just happened. After sorting some logistics for a bit we decide to head to the Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. We weren\'t able to get reservations, but we thought we\'d just try our luck. We get a ride over to the resort, which is two over from ours, but within the same complex. This is clearly the posh hotel and it is stunning. It\'s a massive covered tile lobby with a large sun-tiled dome. There are massive cast clam shells (Venus De Milo esque) with humongous cuttlefish serving as the columns. Further on the smooth tiled floors drop straight into a shallow, tropical looking pool. It\'s dark out, but there is some subtle lighting. As we approach the pool, we find a black swan standing on an island about ten meters from us. Another few dozen meters past her we spot a flamboyance of flamingos. It is as majestic as it sounds. We walk onward to the restaurant. Our luck holds out and, within a few minutes, we are sat at a table drinking red wine and eating buttery garlic bread. Before long the servers are bringing by skewers of crispy chicken thighs, juicy tenderloin, seasoned sausages, spare ribs, and cinnamon-rubbed pineapple. It is a feast and doesn\'t take long for us to tap out. Back to the hotel we pack for a few and then head to the lobby bar for some reconnecting, meeting new folks like Natalie and Frank, karaoke (I sing Tenderness), and final goodbyes.<br><br>We get just a few hours sleep before an early trip to the airport.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"20.756107 -86.958137","From":"Oct 1, 2021","To":"Oct 4, 2021","People":"Evelyn, Greg, Rose, Angela, April, Adrianne, Jason, Andrew, Veritay, Caitlyn, Christine, Carrie, Natalie","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/wBJuq5y7o1SW6v2v8"},{"City":"Naples","Trip":"Just for Fun","Id":"261","Photo":"x","Description":"We take a long and windy mountain road to Naples. Liz booked us a funky hotel in a funky part of town. Driving and parking is pretty stressful. I manage to navigate some incredibly tight alleys. She\'s not feeling well from the heat so I head out solo for a while to take in the city. This city makes me think of Berlin in the 90s or probably Portland now. It\'s dirty and poor and totally alive. I eat unknown fried food on the cobblestone and and buy a Aperol spritz from a man selling alcohol from a table in front of an unmarked door. It seemed to be pretty normal. I watch an old woman let her dog take a big shit in the middle of a busy pedestrian area and walk away. Liz still isn\'t feeling well so I grab a margherita pizza with some fried foods to go from Matteo, a beer from the street guy, plus a cannoli and head back to the room to eat some very yummy food.<br><br>The ac control doesn\'t work so the machine pumps out very chilly air until I cut the power and then a few hours later get hot an turn it back on. We get up late. Downstairs at a cafe, a man with \\"I fucking hate you\\" tattooed on his thigh asks for the time. We pass by a shop of curiosities. It is closed, but we are entranced by the window display featuring many busts of a blindfolded Lady Fortune, statues of the Devil, and bronze penises. To Matteo for a fritta, which is basically a deep fried pizza with crust on both sides. It is messy and delicious. The cool looking church is already booked for the day so we head north to Piazza Bellini where a man pulls up on a bicycle with a PA attached playing The Boss, by The Braxtons. This city is covered in graffiti and street art. Next up to Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Nipoli, where we are a bit let down to find the Gabinetto Segreto (secret cabinet), full of ancient erotic art from Pompei, has already closed for the day. We do take in some lovely mosaics that are old enough to make the Rembrandt seem like a contemporary of Ai Wei Wei. Up to the second floor, the main hall is featuring an extensive exhibit about gladiators, covering everything from the arena architecture, to the warriors clothing and diet, to the different weaponry and fighting styles, to the politics of funding an event. It is very educational and interesting. Next is a massive model and rooms of artifacts from Pompei. Frescoes from there and then we\'re feeling pretty done. The museum is not air conditioned and by the end Liz is starting to feel unwell. We walk back to the hotel and Liz lies down for a few hours to recuperate. At around 10:30 we head out. Sorbillo still has a long line out front so we opt for something less conspicuous. We get a Diavolo and a Romana pizza. They are both unmemorable. To bed.<br><br>Up early and we hit the road to Pompei. Everything goes smoothly and before long we\'re ready for our tour with Guillermo and a kind Italian couple. He is incredibly informative on both Italian history and metal music. He teaches is an Italian sign for casting out bad spirits, which Ronnie James Dio learned from his grandmother, started using at concerts and became the standard metal \\"sign of the Devil\\". Guillermo tells us that in 79 ad the volcano shot 200,000 tons of ash and debris per second for about two days. The cloud of junk shot 40km into the sky and, becuase of the direciton of the wind, landed right on top of Pompei and the surrounding area. Considering the city had a volcano explode onto it and was covered in fifteen meters of debris and ash for nearly two millennium it\'s in remarkable condition. Many of the frescoes within people\'s homes are still clearly visible. The city is vast and would take days to really explore, but he takes us on a greatest hits tour of some well-preserved amphitheaters, streets, homes, shops, brothels, temples, casted bodies, political signs, mosaics, frescoes, phallic objects, baths, pots, fountains, architectural features, and the acropolis. The word used for brothel here is \'lupanare\', which essentailly translates to \'wolf den\'. He suggests is was called that because the prostitutes would howl on the stree corners to attract attention. We have a great time and learn a lot. On top of that, the weather was fairly cool and the crowd was pretty quiet today. We purchase a flying penis ornament and head to the parking lot, which has a restaurant attached and offered a discount for us eating there. My initial expectations weren\'t high, but holy hell it was good. We started with a charcuterie board of mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, ricotta, salami, prosciutto, and lardo. Liz very accurately described the mozzarella being cut as \\"weeping milk\\". The main was a damn fine calzone stuffed with ham, ricotta, and mozzarella, and mushrooms. Pompei was so great that we decide to also visit Ercolano, a smaller coastal town west of Visuvus which was better preserved than Pompei due to it receiving mainly ash deposit. It is so well preserved and reconstructed that it doesn\'t even feel real. The scale of time that were seeing is so much further than any habitable structures we\'ve seen in America, the UK, or  Japan. These don\'t feel like ancient ruins, like Stonehenge, these are relatable. There are kitchens, stoves, baths, shops, gardens, bedrooms, paintings and so much that makes it feel very real and very immediate. I don\'t have to try very hard to imagine people living and breathing here. I learn that many people ran to the docks on the coast with the hope of surviving. However, the 30 km cloud of heat and ash which the poured down on the town didn\'t care about the coastline; in fact, it extended the coast out another 1.5 km. The docks we saw were filled with skeletons. There is no way to transition these two things, but next we drive to see the Fendi headquarters building, which is known as the \\"square coliseum\\". It sits alone at the top of a hill and is beautiful. Next we drive to Fumicino where after checking into the hotel, we head for dinner at a riverside seafood restaurant. The salmon tartare with raspberries is pretty weird, but the slapping pasta with sea bass and the katsu tuna steak are pretty awesome. I try taking the wine bottle out of its ice pack and accidentally knock my glass off the table doing so. It all happens pretty slowly, but Liz watches the whole thing go down without taking her lips off of her glass. A group of kids next to us is being pretty annoying playing hide-and-seek around our table. We make some understanding gestures with an older woman sitting next to us. Before we know it, she is telling Liz, in French, that she is an ambassador of orphan (often?) children and has a villa in Tunisia. She stops the playing children and forces them to apologize to us. Then, we\'re not entirely sure, but we think she guilts the restaurant into giving us a free disgestivo for our troubles.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"40.851208, 14.257964","From":"Sep 8, 2021","To":"Sep 10, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino","NumberInTrip":"","One":"40.750239, 14.486884","Two":"40.804446, 14.347535","Three":"40.851208, 14.257964","Four":"41.771630, 12.231103","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69"},{"City":"Amalfi Coast","Trip":"Just for Fun","Id":"260","Photo":"x","Description":"I start the day with a cappuccino downstairs. Even though we leave 20 minutes early, we still aren\'t able to make our train on time. Everything here seems to take quite a bit longer than we\'re used to. We get the car and they \\"upgrade\\" (ie they were out of the other cars) us to an automatic, which I am quite relieved to learn. I spend the next three hours cussing out asshole drivers that might actually be worse than Texans. I think the general mentality here is that the larger your vehicle is the more you get to ignore that other cars exist. The first two hours are on larger autostrada and the final hour involves skirting the jagged coastline with vehicles hell-bent on treating the narrow roads like a race track. Once at Atrani, Carlo helps lug the bags up many flights of narrow stairs to our room with an absolutely charming view of the town. We are pretty wiped and nap for a bit. Around 6 we get up. Just as we are about to head out a burst of wind, rain and lightning hit and keep us locked in for a while longer. Fortunately, the view of the storm is spectacular. When the sky slows to a steady trickle we brave the outdoors. Down the stairs and through the mountain passageway and we are dropped right in the middle of Almafi. We stop for a gelato when the rains pick up again. We window shop our way up the charming main street until the shops close. Back down the street and through the tunnel to La Palma where we dine in white wine, mussels, fries, linguine with anchovy garum, and local fish with \\"crazy sauce\\". The meal and weather work together to create a lovely evening. We end with a limoncello and head back to the room for some nice times.<br><br>We check out and catch a ferry to Positano, where we will spend the next two hours exploring the touristy, but still quaint town. We buy a nice lemon painted serving dish for my mom\'s wedding present and dine on a delicious lemon custard tart cup. Back to Amalfi where we pick up a cute lemon ornament, put down a panino, gobble granita, and buy some booze.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"40.635940, 14.608523","From":"Sep 7, 2021","To":"Sep 8, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino","NumberInTrip":"","One":"40.635940, 14.608523","Two":"40.634807, 14.602011","Three":"40.629530, 14.486382","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69"},{"City":"Rome","Trip":"Just for Fun","Id":"259","Photo":"x","Description":"We both got COVID tests two days ago, but I still haven\'t received my results as the plane is boarding. We opt not to risk landing without results so head back home and decide to try again tomorrow.<br><br>This time we have scheduled rapid tests at the airport. We get them and get on the flight. The woman sitting next to me does a sharp sniff about every 5-10 seconds for the entire 10-hour flight. I don\'t sleep. On the train into town there are miles of blocks of worn-looking apartment buildings; all about 9 stories tall. There\'s lots of graffiti. Some of it is quite good. One piece features a demon giving us the middle finger. We pass under an aqueduct. Walking out of the metro we see the Spanish Steps to our right. There are many of them and they look very pretty. We arrive at the very charming Hotel Mozart at around 11. Our room is ready so we decide to lie down for just a few minutes...we finally force ourselves out of bed at 3. We hit the pavement and walk down a small but crowded street with many shops. After about 15 minutes walking south we pass by a promising restaurant called Osteria Bacco where we enjoy Aperol spritzes, artichoke (in both the Roman and Jewish styles), fried squash blossom with mozzarella and anchovy, and a beef carpaccio with rosemary and black truffle. Fabio, our server, is an absolute gem and recommends a white dessert wine from Umbria, where he is from. It is less sweet than a Vin Santo and has pleasing notes of mineral and honey. With the wine, he also serves us a special type of almond biscotti called a cantucci, which pairs particularly well with the wine. We walk not even two minutes to Trevi Fountain, which is gorgeous. It feels like Las Vegas. In a few more minutes we stop at a restaurant bar for some espresso. We spend the next two hours meandering our way by the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, the Jewish neighborhood, and a dizzying array of beautiful buildings, streets, corners, shops, and bistros. At around 8 we arrive at Da Enzo to find a line about three times the capacity of the restaurant and decide to head towards Tonnarello, a place one of Liz\'s colleagues recommended. The wait here is a much more reasonable twenty minutes. We start with a bottle of Chianti and a few cestino, which are essentially Roman arancini. Dinner is cacio e pepe and amatriciana (guanciale, tomato, pecorino). The spaghetti is pleasantly thick and chewy on both. The cacio e pepe is very good, but doesn\'t quite meet our memory of last time. The amatriciana is cheesy, salty, and incredible. We chat with our neighbor, Phillip from Birmingham (Alabama), for a good bit before taking an exciting cab ride back to the hotel and crashing.<br><br>We were meant to head to Naples today, but car rentals are completely booked, so we opt to spent another day in Rome. We drink a few cappuccinos at the cafe next door while we plan our day. Next we head to a grocery down the street for some pistachio butter, licorice treats, and cantuccini. For lunch we head south, past the Spanish Steps, to Piccolo Buco. The appetizer is two anchovies sitting atop a few curls of butter all on a single piece of toast. It is absolute perfection. Pizza 1 is four cheese with a yellow tomato sauce. Pizza 2 is fried cubed eggplant with local sliced mozzarella on red sauce. This is a unique style of pizza where the crust under the sauce part is almost paper thin and the edge crust is a massive pillow of crispy deliciousness. Back to the hotel again to drop the leftovers off. Liz is feeling a bit tired and decides to take a nap. I rent an electric standing scooter and head towards the Vatican. The streets are very bumpy and it\'s an exciting ride. I arrive at the city walls only to be told that they are closed for the rest of the day. I loop around the entire country before heading back across the water to the antique shop-heavy neighborhood. We are on the hunt for some sweet mid-century Italian cocktail glasses. No luck at the 8 or so shops visit, but a lovely purveyor tells me the story of Romelus and Remus when she sees me eyeing a statue of two babies suckling the teets of a massive wolf. I wait in the beautiful square for a few minutes until Liz meets me. We walk together south to Trastevere and get in line for Da Enzo. The line is quite long, but we somehow make it in the first seating. To start we order a carafe of the house red with a plate of pre-pulled burrata. It is almost soup-like from all of the cream and the strands of cheese twirl around my fork like fettuccine. We order the same pastas as last night: cacio e pepe and amatriciana. Wow wow wow. Last night was great, but these are both superlative. The cacio e pepe has LOTS of coarse fresh ground pepper on top and throughout which gives a pleasing, almost menthol brightness that cuts through the creaminess of the cheese. For the amatriciana they use a rigatoni pasta, which is a perfect little train car for transporting the thick, cheesy sauce and gives a delightful surprise with each bite. The red sauce is umami-rich and carries notes of sharp cheese and pork fat. The guanciale is cut into little rectangular sheets and seared crispy to house the unearthly flavor. Somehow we convince ourselves that we have room for tiramisu, which I don\'t regret one bit. The cocoa powder is topped heavily just before serving, the custard has a rich eggy texture, and there\'s a soft chocolate dollop near the bottom. All that plus a coffee-soaked lady finger on the side makes for the perfect ending. After a long stroll winding our way north through the city streets, we are back at the hotel where we crash for a bit. At midnight we get up to watch Eric Weirheim make orange chicken.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"41.835522, 12.465640","From":"Sep 4, 2021","To":"Sep 7, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Rome, Atrani, Amalfi, Positano, Naples, Pompei, Ercolano, Fumicino","NumberInTrip":"","One":"41.835522, 12.465640","Two":"40.634807, 14.602011","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/5ZnucdHeJZacP6g69"},{"City":"St Louis","Trip":"Ranch Life","Id":"258","Photo":"x","Description":"We get a ride from the airport to Catalyst for an okay cold brew and some okay art.

After an hour of trains and getting bumped into by folks (personal space seems to be a thing of the past here) we arrive at Moxy Bastille. Our room isn\'t ready, so we do some quick cleaning up. We are surprised to find a text from Melvin saying he is at the brunch restaurant waiting for us (we mistakenly thought the plan was to meet tomorrow). We rush out and meet them about 20 min later. They had given up on the boat restaurant because the food looked crap. We walk a few minutes instead to a charming tiny place where we sip on nice coffee and catch up. Shortly our Benedict and savory burrata french toast arrives and we chow down on that for a good bit. Alexia tells us of her new passion in wound care. From there, Melvin shows us down a narrow, cafe-lined street which he calls \\"Vieux Paris\\". It\'s sort of a cleaner French version of Piss Alley. Alexia leaves to go visit with her brother. I buy some peacock stationary. Moments later we walk by a specialty shop selling only canned seafood from Belle Isle. Only a few more moments later I get pajamas from Muji. Walking again we see protestors protesting. Melvin then leads us for about 20 minutes to Bon Marche, a classy and beautiful department store & food market. We try on lovely cologne at Le Labo and gawk at the furniture upstairs before exploring the food hall. We sit down at the patisserie and share a Paris Brest, an apple tart, and a Tarte Trop√©zienne. We part ways. On the train, a woman is either preaching or begging. She pulls out an egg shaker and makes an absolute mockery of what is probably a decent a French tune with her lazy, meandering voice. Back to the hotel. We are both nearly delirious with exhaustion and sleep until the sun is low in the sky. Just before sunset we muster the energy to walk the 400 meters to Chez Janou. David recommended this place based I think solely on the fact that they serve chocolate mousse from a comically large bowl. We didn\'t necessarily have the highest expectations for anything but the mousse. As it turned out though, the atmosphere, service, wine, mussels, steak, and mousse were all very lovely. We walk back and go straight to sleep.<br><br>Eventually we eat breakfast, shower and head out. Our first stop is Fringe for a to-go cold brew. Onto Ladur√©e where we pick up macrons for Rob & Tony. We also stay for an orange blossom macron and a St Honour, a mountain of whipped cream atop a mound of vanilla custard and brulee pastry. Liz orders in French. Elle est parfaite. Le Metro. We stop by the newly renovated La Samaritaine to appreciate the ornate iron staircase and partake in the photomaton. A little further on and we\'re at the Louvre. We descend into the glass pyramid, use the facilities, snack on some Paul, and begin. First stop is the Greek sculpture hall to appreciate Liz\'s favorite piece: Cupid reviving Psyche. We get a bit lost, but soon make our way up to Mona Lisa. After a nap on a bench we head through the rooms of Louis XIV and Napoleon, filled with hanging tapestries, scarlet wallpaper, golden pocket watches, long dining tables, Egyptian booty, lacquered cabinets, marble penises, and, of course, a dragon\'s hoard worth of paintings. Paintings depicting wars, revolutions, coronations, monkeys stealing fruit, Greek heroes (including the same scene we saw earlier of Cupid and Psyche), capitalist armadas, Jesus, clothed women, partially clothed women, nude women, angles, daemons, and countless cherubs. Two trains later we are back at the hotel for a deep late-afternoon nap. When the sun is nearly down we get up, noodle around a bit, and hit the pavement. Earlier in the day we walked by our old haunt, Candelaria, and now it is calling our name. On the patio we dine on frozen margaritas, frijoles with chips, and a platter of duck confit mole tacos. We leave nothing behind. Into the back room for a Mango-Bango and a Royal Street. Our server is kind and allows us to choose whether we prefer to speak in French or English. This has actually happened numerous times on this trip already. There seems to be a newly found patience for budding Francophones amongst the Parisians.

Liz wants to check out the Dickies store so we do that before crossing back into the cultural South.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"32.733930, -97.369295","From":"Jul 24, 2021","To":"Jul 25, 2021","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"Amsterdam","Trip":"Cats, Rats, Cookie Surprise","Id":"251","Photo":"x","Description":"On the flight we both get the pasta, which we both think seems to taste very meat like. I watch The Farewell and The Father, both of which are great, and then sleep a while. We check into the hotel, which has two cats. Liz has some difficulty changing shirts in the lobby. Bagels at Bagels & Beans. The man sitting next to us is making a lot of mouth sucking sounds and it\'s grossing me out. We walk to Centraal to catch an hour-long bus ride to Zaanse Schans, a traditional Dutch windmill village complete with windmills, cheese, and goats. We take our time taking it all in and taking pictures. The sky is a pale blue with a few puffy clouds dotted around and there is a hearty breeze breathing life into the big pinwheels. After walking up on side for a while we catch a ferry across the river and walk back down a quaint street. We stop in a pub, but after 10+ minutes without a server approaching us, we give up and leave. A cyclist asks for directions to a town we\'ve never heard of. We catch a bus then metro. A man waiting behind us on the train is making cuckoo whistles‚Äìapparently to encourage us to move quicker. First we eat frites with Andalouse, then we wait to buy cookies, and lastly return to the hotel. On the bed where we munch down a delicious dark cocoa cookie. It\'s crispy on the outside and nearly gooey in the center. There is a ribbon of milk chocolate running through the dough and a big lump of pillowy white chocolate smack in the middle. Then we crash. We wake up hours later and I don\'t know what day it is. We meet the guys by a leather bar and grab okay Italian. We share a cheese pizza with basil on top and sort of a pasta cabbage roll. Afterwards we sit on a bridge, drink beers, shares stories of our day, and watch the sun very slowly fade away. By 10:30 it\'s finally dark and we call it an evening. One more quick cone of frites on the way home and then to bed.<br><br>After a short walk in the beautiful morning air we are at Rum Baba where we share a superlative cold brew and oat cortado. We alternate sips with bites of the same chocolate cookies from yesterday. The combination of the cookie with cold brew creates a new taste, which is eerily similar to a margarita pizza. We walk northeast for about 15 minutes and arrive at the Katten Kabinet, a whimsical old building decorated with paintings of cats, statues of cats, and real-life cats. 6 minutes west and we are at our old haunt, Singel 404, for a burrata sandwich and a chicken, goat cheese, and tapenade sandwich. We pick up another six-pack of cookies to take home and then stop back at the hotel for a not so quick nap followed by a good touch. Walk and tram over to Brouwerij \'t IJ. I ask for the beer with the ostrich on it, which gives Liz a good chuckle (the ostrich is their logo and on every tap). We get a hapjesplank of sausage and cheese plus a few more beers, all of which are lovely. On the street a family of rats is sharing a loaf of bread. Oosterpark is just a few minutes away, so we head there. First we lie down for a bit by the lake where a couple of coots come to say hello. The sky is golden, a few couples are dancing on a raised stage, two men are practicing kickboxing, and another is playing a kora. After I fail to traverse a set of hanging rings and Liz gets pooped on by a bird we take a tram back to the hotel. We watch a few minutes of The Fall of the House of Usher before heading to meet Michael & David at Tales & Spirits for Milk Punch, Zombies, fried chicken and more. They tell how their train from Germany was delayed because someone had to diffuse a WWII-era bomb near the track.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"52.473523, 4.817770","From":"Jul 17, 2021","To":"Jul 18, 2021","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/kVdKGfyj9xm5ZSha7"},{"City":"Las Vegas","Trip":"Hubs","Id":"250","Photo":"x","Description":"Just as we land I get a call from Jeremy. We chat for a good while and he encourages us to have a boy and name him Tristain. We check into the Weston. Liz goes to sleep and I investigate the Flamingo. I realize this isn\'t even the hotel I had in mind when I shared a vision of hanging in Vegas with Liz, it was the Tropicana. I practice playing poker on a 5¬¢ machine. It takes me a good while at least to lost my $10.<br><br>After a solid workout and a pretty good hotel breakfast we take the bus to the National Atomic Testing Museum where we learn about early atomic bomb design and the different test sites used in the US. Next to Burg(e)r for truffle fries, a meh black garlic Caesar salad, and a good Hell\'s Kitchen burger. We check out of the Westin and into Tropicana. Unfortunately the pool is closing so we relax in the room for a bit before taking a very long and very raucous bus ride up to the Sahara where we have reservations for Jos√© Andreas\' Meat Bazaar. We order Ferran Adria olives, steak tartare, a 16oz chateaubriand, and very buttery potato pur√©e. Liz is wiped and wants to head to bed. I am still alert so I explore Circus Circus, whose filth I adore; Resort World, a bland mall; and Excalibur, which is quite a bit nicer than I expected.<br><br>I walk to Eataly only to discover a ~50 person line with only one barista working. Back to Starbucks for breckie and then to the pool for a bit of sun, a nice swim, surprise ducks, and a magnum Pi√±a Colada. Shower up and then we get a ride to Hell\'s Kitchen for foie gras, seared scallops, a Beef Wellington, and a sinful sticky toffee pudding. We walk down to Bally\'s where, after being enticed by some praise-giving french women trying to sell me $300 moisturizer, we play 18 holes of Twilight Zone themed mini golf. While the course design is a bit lackluster the decor is absolutely on point. There are many statues and murals depicting scenes from famous episodes. We follow that up with a few rounds of Twilight Zone pinball. From there we catch a bus to The Golden Tiki, which blows our minds. It might be the most well-designed tiki bar I\'ve ever seen. Our bartender described it as Disneyland on acid, which is not wrong. The door stall handles are brass dicks. We imbibe some very nice drinks plus coconut shrimp and perfect crab wontons. Another bus up to Herbs and Rye for some classic cocktails and a chat with Scotty, a bartender from Phoenix. A kind driver drops us off on Fremont street, which is hopping. I see as many men wearing thongs here as women. We pop quickly into Circa for a few hands of digital Blackjack before walking to Taqueria Casa Del Pastor for al pastor tacos and killer carne asada quesadilla. Though it\'s nighttime, the asphalt still radiates heat. An oven recently powered off. We eat while power walking to the Neon Museum. Holy cow this place is incredible; truly a treasure trove of bygone signage. Many of the pieces are wonderfully restored and all of them are arranged in such a way to give the sense of being in a dreamy cemetery of letters and limbs. Our guide gives good context for many of the works. We board a bus back to Fremont for more of giving Circa our money and then another bus back to the Tropicana.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"36.126057, -115.192238","From":"Jun 26, 2021","To":"Jun 29, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas","NumberInTrip":"5","One":"25.780652, -80.128626","Two":"39.965684, -75.181051","Three":"34.146892, -118.255722","Four":"33.397986, -111.480571","Five":"36.126057, -115.192238","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6"},{"City":"Phoenix","Trip":"Hubs","Id":"249","Photo":"x","Description":"Anne & Richard pick us up and take us home where we all spend a good while catching up.

Anne makes a delicious fried calf liver, rashers, onions, potatoes and gravy. Richard goes to bed and Phoebe drops us off in downtown Gilbert at White Rabbit‚Äîa pretty hip and busy speakeasy. We have a couple rounds of fancy drinks including one that tasted like a Terry\'s chocolate apricot. We also snack on bacon wrapped figs and truffle Gouda mac.<br><br>The four of us head to Robbie\'s for Tristain\'s memorial service.

Preston teaches me about the gameplay structure of Fortnite. Stetson gives me a firm pat on the back. Liz gest overheated so back at the house we all relax for a bit. Once we\'re up we squeeze in a short game of Catan where Anne sneaks in a steal literally at the buzzer. Over to Phoebe\'s for a bit to oogle her plants and cuddle Canon & Crusty. She takes us by In-n-Out before dropping us at the airport for our flight to Vegas. On the plane, before takeoff, a flight attendant asks a man if he\'s okay because she sees him shaking.

To the hotel where we rest ever so quickly before having to leave again. Traffic here moves very slowly and everything seems very far apart. It takes an hour to get to Glendale, even though it\'s only about 9 miles away as the crow flies. Liz tries on some cute sailor pants. We drive over to Glendale where we wander a mall for a bit to kill time until our dinner reservations at Sushi Sasabune. We both opt for the omakase, which turns out to be an excellent choice. The two tataki are killer as are the 12 nigiri they serve us. Just as we\'re about to leave a couple walks in. I comment to \\"She is stunning\\" to which Liz replies \\"She\'s Dita Von Teese\\"! Liz covers her face and cries tears of joy. We contemplate whether it\'s appropriate to say hi and after a few minutes decided yes. It is pretty short and sweet. Liz tells her about looking forward to ordering from her new site. Dita recommends a bar. We thank them and part ways. Neither of us can stop smiling for the next hour. We go straight to Bigfoot Lodge, the bar Dita recommended, which she accurately described as a rockabilly dive lodge. After a drink and our emotions settle down we go straight home and to bed.<br><br>I wake up early and work out. Then we drive down Melrose to Courage Bagels for a salmon bagel and a veggie bagel. They are both on \\"burnt everything\\" and are very likely the best bagels we\'ve ever eaten in our lives. West again to LACMA for some very good modern & contemporary by Kandinsky, Klee, Picasso, L√©ger, Pollack, Magritte, Kusama, Yoshitoshi and so many more. The museum is gorgeous and feels great to be in. Churro batter ice cream from the store and then a break at the hotel. After a particularly good touch we head to Santa Monica for some beach times. The shore is steep and the waves are aggressive. We hold hands, share memories, take pictures and get sandy. Next to Blossom Vietnamese for yummy spring rolls, noodle \\"salad\\", and sublime broth ph√≥. We are both feeling pretty wiped so we opt to go back to the hotel where we fall straight into a deep sleep.<br><br>Primo Donuts for a great orange glaze cake baby before our flight to Phoenix.","WindowPlacement":"","LatLng":"34.146892, -118.255722","From":"Jun 23, 2021","To":"Jun 25, 2021","People":"","Locations":"Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas","NumberInTrip":"3","One":"25.780652, -80.128626","Two":"39.965684, -75.181051","Three":"34.146892, -118.255722","Four":"33.397986, -111.480571","Five":"36.126057, -115.192238","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ATGJrc938LYCkmem6"},{"City":"Philadelphia","Trip":"Hubs","Id":"247","Photo":"x","Description":"The hotel receptionist lets us check in waaay early, so that\'s nice. I try to clean out the hair-clogged sink, but am defeated. We stroll past the gorgeous and massive City Hall before sipping beans at La Colombe. Underground to the train and down to Pat\'s for a definitely better than Geno\'s cheese steak. The meat is tender and juicy and the bread feels fresh and not mass-produced. Little Saigon is just north, so we walk through that next‚Äîit\'s pretty run down and not as charming as we\'d hoped. A nice driver takes us to the Philadelphia Museum of Art where we spend the next few hours appreciating Duchamps, Picasso, Magritte, Van Gogh, Renoir, Rodin, along with a some older Flemish and Italian Renaissance masters who painted some trippy stuff. After a snack at Whole Foods we ride the bus to Fishtown. Contrary to what Dee Reynolds would have me believe it is surprisingly pleasant. At Pizzeria Beddia we eat beans in olive oil & lemon zest, bread with tomato sauce, and asparagus, shiitake, lemon & dill pizza. Afterward we pick up a few beers, head back to the hotel, and watch Minari.<br><br>We sleep in late, which is lovely. We kiss and celebrate being married for our favorite 8 years. Eventually we walk over to Reading Terminal Market where we pick up a pork roll breakfast sandwich, some Peking duck wraps, and a cannoli. After that I walk the shops, but don\'t find anything. I come back and work out. We are feeling lazy and hang for a while longer. We have an early reservation for Zahav so at 4 we head out. We sit at the bar and are immediately served all sorts of delicious salads (eggplant, beet, cabbage, carrot, fennel, green beans), hummus, and herb flatbread. We get some lovely drinks and continue to get bombarded with dishes like fried halloumi in honeysuckle syrup, carrot schnitzel, seared bass with tahini, grilled apricot, crispy rice, lamb shoulder in pomegranate sauce, and ice cream biscuit sandwiches. We meet Evelyn and Greg nearby for drinks at Sassafras. After a while there we head for a second round at Charlie Was a Sinner. They are both so lovely.

Only about half of the urinals are occupied, but when I turn around I find someone waiting behind me for my stall. Leaving the airport, we see a big iguana on the side of road. To Moxy and then to Havana Viejo for mojitos, tostones (stuffed plantains), and mojo marinated pork leg. It is an auspicious beginning. We walk down the main drag near Miami Beach. This place feels like a non-stop party. Liz comments that it\'s like a beach Vegas where everyone is dressed like it\'s a pride parade. There are a lot of see-through pants. A lot of them. We bear the heat and walk to Time Out Market for a Rocher and coffee. Liz gets a beach hat from Goorin before we head back to the hotel for a deep sleep. Today is Angie\'s birthday, so we call her to catch up a bit. To Ceviche 105 for a trio of ceviches, fried corn nuts, and smoked lobster & plantain maki. Our final stop is Broken Shaker‚Äîa cocktail bar in a lush jungle environment. The bar has regularly been voted as on of the top 50 cocktail bars in the world. It definitely wasn\'t.<br><br>We munch down a pecan croissant and a guava cheese danish before hitting the beach. The water is pleasant, aqua-green and shallow with gentle waves. Only a few yards in front of us a man gets fully undressed before taking a dip. He doesn\'t look cold at all. Back to the mainland where we grab subs from Publix, which are delightful. Thanks Michelle! The art museum is full so we opt to wander Wynwood. This area is dense with local shops and galleries. Every wall has art on it. We get a lovely cold brew from Panther where an elderly Chad has a tantrum when they tell him there is no Splenda. Liz tries on some Ray Bans. We get caught in the rain while walking to grab a tamarindo mojito. Next we catch a ride to Little Havana for fritas‚ÄîCuban burgers with chorizo‚Äîat El Rey.

He is playing violin for the traffic. We check into our suite, crash for just a few, and catch a ride to Roma. The taco shop we want is closed. We walk for just a minute and find two nice ladies who make us biztec and campechano tacos, which are amazing. We wander from Roma to the park. A man is playing a type of small, hand-cranked nickelodeon and is having a blast doing it. We stop by a large fountain and gaze at the goddess Diana\'s incredible butt. We head into the park. Appreciate some clothes statues and then catch a cab to Quintonil. Our reservation is for 3:45. By 6, we are ten courses deep plus a hacienda margarita and a Ramos Gin Fizz. Everything is incredible. We explore a nearby square, visit a Sally store, and then sleep for 15 hours.<br><br>After a mediocre hotel breakfast we head to the anthropological museum. In the park outside the museum there is an exercise class doing Pulp Fiction esque dance moves to Rock around the Clock. A minute further along, we hear live flute and drum. We pass through the trees to see where it\'s coming from and find four men in elaborate costume hanging upside-down and spinning from a 100 foot pole. They are playing the music. As they spin, their ropes lower slowly towards the ground. It is called Danza de los Voladores, Dance of the Flyers. Next we do the museum, which is massive and stunning. There are a few temple facade reconstructions, which are particularly impressive. After tasty elotes, tlayudas, and horchata on the street we walk through the park for a good while. At one point we hear the same flute and drum music. We look around for another group of swinging men, but I don\'t see them. After a minute Liz pulls out her phone to realize she had the video of them playing in her pocket. We tire out and get a cab to Baltra, a cocktail bar in Roma. After a clarified horchata punch we walk through a park where a very talented man is doing Beatles covers with an elaborate one-man-band setup on his back. A al pastor vendor on the street grabs our attention and we dine on incredible street tacos. Next is Licoreria Limantour where, when we ask the host how long the wait will be, we are informed that time is relative, but probably around 30 minutes. After longer than that we give up and get a ride to Taqueria Los Cocuyos for tacos with mostly non muscle meats. I\'m not sure what we had, but at least one was tripa. They were good though. We walk for about 20 and land in Plaza Garibaldi, which is the center for mariachi music in the city. There are dozens of bands hanging out in full regalia. Many are playing for just one or two people. We take it all in for a while before settling on a nice looking Norteno group, who play us a groovy tune.<br><br>After a workout and a better breakfast we get a ride to Teotihuacan. We arrive at the gates an hour later to be told it is closed for the rest of the day because they already hit capacity. Our driver recommends a canal area on the south side of town so we go for it. Almost another hour and a half later we arrive. We get tacos from a stand and hop on a colorful boat. The canal is jam packed with other boats, but the weather is great, the vibes are great, and there\'s beer in a bucket. Various vendors in canoes who pull up along side us to offer their goods. A woman is frying tortillas in one. In another a man is roasting corn. Some canoes have mariachi bands who will board boats and play for passengers. One canoe has a DJ who appears to be shooting a music video. After about an hour of bumper boat madness we break off down a quiet canal. The whole experience is lovely and nowhere near the tourist trap I was worried it might be. Back to the hotel to put on some Plan 9 from Outer Space for just a bit. Hanky Panky for cocktails and snacks. Just as we are about to leave we meet Ali and Amy, US & Canadian nomads who have been bouncing between Turkey and Mexico since September. We close down the bar chatting with them.<br><br>Neither of is feels 100% today so we take it easy, get some more tacos, tepache, and a quesadilla from down the street, and make out way back home.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"19.418720, -99.167852","From":"Apr 16, 2021","To":"Apr 19, 2021","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rp9QuWsmPHydD73S7"},{"City":"Yellowstone National Park","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":"244","Photo":"x","Description":"We nab the last spot at the Lewis Lake campsite and setup the tent. There is still a bit of light in the sky, so we drive to West Thumb, a hot spring and mud pot cluster. There are hundreds of craters in the ground ranging in size from toilet bowl to backyard pool. The liquid spectrum is clay slip to phone screen protector. All of the springs have water runoff, on which live bacterial mats that can take on colors like hot dog mustard, old car rust, gender confirming blue, and classic brown. The bits of old runoff which aren\'t actively wet are porcelain white; deposits of sodium carbonate the water had absorbed from the limestone below. I learn that Yellowstone National Park exists as the latex skin of a forty-mile diameter magma balloon which is being continuously filled. One day the balloon will pop and make the Earth unrecognizable for tens of thousands of years. Until then it will heat the water table and give life to the geysers, hot springs, and mud pots. I spot some people with cameras crowding together, usually a good sign. I walk over and see a big elk bull and a few elk cows. The bull looks horny and not pleased about the spectators. He looks at us, opens his mouth, and makes a loud scream akin to a child who is first learning to play a trumpet. We don\'t stick around much longer. Back to the campsite where our neighbor, Anthony, has a fire going. We make a peace offering of beer and join around the glow while we chat about Tucson and eat cold pizza. It is so cold out that we don\'t even consider sleeping in the already setup tent. I grab the blanket and bags from it and we settle into the back of the Jeep.<br><br>First stop is Old Faithful. We, very fortunately, get there only about twenty minutes before the next eruption is due to begin. We join the very large crowd and, before long, see it do its thing. It was the most viewed and least beautiful sight we\'d see in the entire trip. Next to Grand Prismatic Spring, which is definitely one of the coolest sights of the trip. The microbial mats are so strongly colored, that the steam rising from the water takes on a rainbow spectrum. After failing to get signal for a while in Madison, we head to Canyon Village to check out the waterfalls and \\"Yellowstone Grand Canyon\\". The upper and lower falls are both stunning and the canyon is a feast for the senses I could easily spend hours taking in. Unfortunately, we didn\'t have that long. Our goal was to reach Hayden Valley, a vast grassy meadow, which we heard is perfect for wildlife viewing. A few minutes into the plains and we spot elk in the distance as well as bison, lots of bison. We park above a river and watch a few dozen bovines feed, drink, swim, and nap. The entire valley is steeped in tones of gold, straw, and amber. I am zoomed in at 300mm, taking in the gorgeous beasts and absorbed in the light and color. Time slows down a while. Slower than I expected, the light eventually fades and the even chill quickly kicks in. We drive to the nearest town, Gardiner, where we eat mediocre pizza and find a spot off the side of a road to park.<br><br>Up at six, which I will later find out wasn\'t early enough to see a pack of wolves chase a grizzly bear across the plains of Lamar Valley. We do arrive just after that though and are able to catch, very far off, a few wolves playing a game of bite the bison. Further down the road about thirty bison are not only right next to the road, but are crossing it regularly, ever in search of the finest blade of grass to ruminate on. It makes for a perfect glamour shots session. We drive next to Mammoth Hot Springs where we chat with a few very friendly and knowledgeable rangers on topics like ranger uniform history, the evolution of forest fire management, and the idiosyncrasies of elk behavior. We first walk, then drive through Mammoth Hot Springs, which are unique in that the calcium carbonate deposits form stunning stepped travertine terraces. The thousand-year in the making sculptures look as though they were taken from the depths of cave. The bone white crust surrounding the active thermal areas adds to the eerie otherworldliness of the place. The day is still young and we are mentally finished with parking so we decide to drive to Spokane. Seven or so hours later we pickup two more duck banh mi, check into our hotel by the airport, and dream of things much bigger, and older, than ourselves.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"44.648575, -110.458950","From":"Sep 9, 2020","To":"Sep 11, 2020","People":"","Locations":"Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park","NumberInTrip":"4","One":"47.657073, -117.423957","Two":"48.687073, -113.741580","Three":"43.761419, -110.732252","Four":"44.648575, -110.458950","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9"},{"City":"Grand Teton National Park","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":"243","Photo":"x","Description":"After a two-hour drive we\'re in Jackson, Wyoming. To a nice cafe for a delicious egg salad on toast and a five-mushroom latte. We drive to the southern tip of Jenny Lake. The Tetons are majestic: jagged and jutting suddenly upward from the flat valley due to one tectonic plate crashing with and slipping under another. There are a few small glaciers on the mountains, but they are melting fast and will be gone in a decade or so. We take a ferry and hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. It seems it snowed heavily last night and now big hunks of snow are falling from the tall pines. Early on I get smacked in the head by a big white dump. The hike is nice, but the ground is cold and wet, which my sock/sandal combo doesn\'t love. From above, Liz spots an entrancing vortex pattern in the intersecting ferry wakes. By the end of the hike the snow is melting to the point that it looks like it\'s raining from the trees. The sky is cloudless and blue. It\'s surreal. Back to Jackson where we order two large pizzas. We park in a camp spot that is already reserved. They pull in while we are brushing our teeth and aren\'t pleased. We find a new, unreserved spot and get real cold.<br><br>Apparently moose are quite plentiful in this area. I keep looking for them. As we drive back into Jackson to a coffee shop for drinks and a breakfast bagel sandwich, my eyes play tricks on me. Every dark tree in the distance is a potential moose. This is how people see Jesus in a dog\'s butt. Liz spots our server from the pizza restaurant at the grocery store. We visit the most-photographed barn in the world and take pictures of the barn next to it. Further north to Coulter Bay where we hike around a nice peninsula that wants to be an island. At the General Store we eat very good huckleberry ice cream. Continuing north we enter Yellowstone.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"43.761419, -110.732252","From":"Sep 8, 2020","To":"Sep 9, 2020","People":"","Locations":"Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park","NumberInTrip":"3","One":"47.657073, -117.423957","Two":"48.687073, -113.741580","Three":"43.761419, -110.732252","Four":"44.648575, -110.458950","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9"},{"City":"Glacier National Park","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":"242","Photo":"x","Description":"In St. Regis we stop for roadside cherries and a huckleberry milkshake. To Kalispell for gas & groceries and then Blankenship Bridge where we camp along the river bank.<br><br>Up at 4:30. At 6 Logan Pass is already filling up. We catch some more sleep and get up around 7:30 to start hiking. Our plan was to do the Highline Trail, but a friendly ranger offers some better advice. First we do the Hidden Lake hike, a three-mile hike to a...hidden lake. On our hike Liz points out the moon. I say, \\"Oh, hi!\\" and point to it, but a woman in the path thinks I\'m pointing at her. I tell her sorry, I was just saying hi to the moon. The lake is closed because of bear activity, but it is a nice view. There is a goat a few feet from me. At one point I think he might charge, but he puts his head down and continues chomping. We sit on a rock and eat peanut butter. Some ground squirrels are very interested in us. Later, a ranger will tell us her name for them, Little Cannibals. Apparently, when one gets hit by a car, others go out to eat it, and then also get hit by cars, resulting in a squirrel pile up. A Hoary Marmot poses for us for a good while. We relax in the car for a bit before we begin the Highline trail. The whole trail is 16 miles, so we opt to only do about a mile in and out. There are some narrow cliff sections, which are pretty scary. The view is incredible. There are something like three dozen glaciers in the park. All are a fraction of the size they were a few decades ago. They will likely all melt in my lifetime. What we think might be a pika says hi. We drive to the end of Going to the Sun Road, then back. To Josephine\'s for a bison gyro and fried chicken. Back to camp along the river where we chat with our neighbors and drink wine. The Milky Way hangs above.<br><br>The night was beautiful and just a bit cool, but at 7am the winds pick up and a serious cold front visits the region. Our next four days will be much colder than we packed for. We had booked a rafting trip, but when we get to the office they inform us it has been cancelled due to the wind. Our next stop is the Montana Mystery House & Vortex, which seemed like a quirky art installation on Atlas Obscura. However, in speaking to the desk attendant and seeing the gift shop it feels a lot more like a scheme designed to prey on the naive. Speaking of schemes designed to prey on the naive, just down the road from the Mystery House is a trailer semi-encircled by about 15 billboards, featuring the Ten Commandments, and statements about Jesus\' ability to save my soul. I stop. Inside is a gift shop selling very large t-shirts, embroidered face masks, and car magnets; all detailing either the Ten Commandments or the healing properties of Jesus. I ask about the masks. The attendant tells me about the pastor in Oregon who believes we don\'t need masks (because god will heal us), but whom was instructed by God to make them to help financially support the church. He mentioned something about a divine discovery of an embroidery machine. I leave, but not before he tells me about how his Columbia shoes were very durable on his mission in Indonesia. Gyro & falafel in Missoula. In Idaho Falls we get a hotel, go to Walmart to buy long-sleeved shirts, and begin watching I\'m Thinking of Ending Things.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"48.687073, -113.741580","From":"Sep 5, 2020","To":"Sep 7, 2020","People":"","Locations":"Spokane, Glacier National Park, Grand Teton Nationl Park, Yellowstone National Park","NumberInTrip":"2","One":"47.657073, -117.423957","Two":"48.687073, -113.741580","Three":"43.761419, -110.732252","Four":"44.648575, -110.458950","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajW5dauqbsCRfrLK9"},{"City":"Spokane","Trip":"Triple Parked","Id":"241","Photo":"x","Description":"We are given a Jeep, which is very nice to drive.

I am aware of how many homeless-looking people there are. We drive south through a cute neighborhood. Some of the quirky homes remind me how conservative Dallas is. We get water, beer, hard kombucha, and chips from a grocery store. Down the road is Manito Park, where we get out and eat a watery Massaman curry next to a small lake. We walk and find a French garden full of flowers and bees being bees. Back downtown, we stop into two vintage shops. I am tempted by scratched Paul Simon vinyl and a porch swing made from the bench of an old Ferris wheel. We check into the Historic Davenport and check out for a bit. The sun is now low in the sky. We pop out and walk to Riverfront Park where we feed the Garbage Goat, sit beneath the big top, and view the falls. We get a very good duck banh mi from Wild Sage and eat it in the room. For the second half of dinner we get a salad and Gorgonzola fries from Downriver Grill and also eat that in the room. We stop by the milk bottle, but it is not lit up.<br><br>We get free breakfast with our room so we head down. I order the crab omelette, which is okay and Liz has a salmon benedict. Back in the room we test out the mattress. Next to REI to buy poop bags. On the road east and to Coeur D\'Alene Coffee Co. for some very nice drinks. Our plan was to stay here tonight, but in doing more research we decide it\'s best to head straight to Glacier.

We are definitely in America. We walk to the Time Out Market where we watch video of ballet dancers playing on an old train station time table. We are stuffed, but there is an orange cardamom poppy donut I want, so we get that and a coffee. We go to Back Bay to shop, but don\'t like anything. We walk east through the first public in America. It is pretty dead, but there are some cute chubby squirrels building nests. We walk for a bit longer and then get a ride to the hotel and nap. Kelly and Chris come by and we catch up for a few before heading to dinner at Forage. We have some yummy cocktails plus root charcuterie, a cheese plate, sunchokes with cacao & tarragon emulsion, house pimento marscapone, roasted carrots, and veg ferments.

It is very entertaining. I take the train to the hotel and find Liz waiting for me in bed. We cuddle for a few and she heads to work. I sleep. After some failed internet login I opt to meditate and work out. I told myself I wouldn\'t drink caffeine on this trip. I\'m already feeling it. I decide to check out a nearby art gallery...which it turns out I\'ve already been to. The art, however, is all different and even better than last time. My favorite piece is a very large balloon that is on a loop of being inflated and deflated. At its peak, it pushes up against both walls and the ceiling. I also am quite fond of the pile of rubble, which is breathing. I get some fake meat and potato chips from a Chinese convenience store. I snack, dress, and walk. Liz meets me and we have a lovely dinner at sixpenny including kangaroo tartare, grouper with celeriac sauce and champagne foam, lovely beef, and Mead custard. Train and walk to Scout for some weird yummy drinks.<br><br>I sleep until 1. Liz gave me her drink voucher, so I head down to the bar where I have an XPA and chat with Joseph, the bartender, for a good while. I walk to Lankan Filling station and meet Liz for delicious Sri Lankan curries and hoppers. Then we get a ride to the Opera House and see the Marriage of Figaro, which is excellent and hard to follow, both in plot and music. We walk to Maybe Sammy for fancy drinks. We walk next to Employees Only, but don\'t like the basic drink club vibe, so we opt to go to bed. <br><br>Up early for our flight to Adelaide. Liz sleeps and I watch Parasite. We take a bus downtown. The town is a bit run down and there are many down and out folks hanging around. It is also charming with beautiful architecture and many cool looking shops. We stop by Lord of the Fries for poutine. We wander the high street for a good bit and I save Liz from sitting on bird poop. We walk down to Central Market and pick up cheese, terrine, kiwi, jam and tomatoes right before they close. We head back north and come upon a big square where we lie on the grass and sun ourselves for a good while. Hungry Jack\'s (Burger King) sells a vegan Rebel Whopper, son we try one and it is delicious. Next we head towards the Botanic Gardens where we take in the beautiful plants and birds for a good bit before heading to the airport to pick up our bags and a car. A good long drive. I see a kangaroo bounce across the road. We get to Cape Jervis, where we stay in a room for the night. There are many millipedes outside. We snack on a loaf of bread the folks at Sixpenny gave us, soft and hard cheese, fig jam, and terrine.<br><br>Up early and to the ferry over to Kangaroo Island where we get a rental car and drive west. We are on the lookout for roos immediately. We see about 4, but they are all roadkill so far. We get to Frogs & Roses, which is a lovely restaurant, nursery, and home. We say hi to Morris, the donkey, as well as some chickens, and a bulldog. After a mediocre lime milkshake and a sage & rosemary pizza, we head on. We go to Flinders Chase, a large park at the western tip of the island. A silly ranger informs me that roos sleep during the day so gave us some things to do for a few hours before coming back to the roo zone. Onward to the century-old lighthouse and the fur seal hangout spot, Admiral\'s Arch. We see some fight and are able to get quite close. They smell like the zoo. We finish our picnic food and head to Remarkable Rock, which is an apt description. It looks like something Gaudi designed. We return to the visitor\'s center where we begin our walk. Immediately we see an echidna snuffling along. We follow him a while and, although we are right next to him, he appears to be completely unaware of us. We walk on and see many fluffy balls in the trees, which are sleepy koalas. They are all over. The we see three kangaroos feeding. Then two more. Then five off in the distance. We walk into a clearing and they are all over. Some are lying down, some are feeding, some are hopping around. The sun is low, there are geese around, and everything is beautiful. We are in a miniature world of animals and I can hardly believe it. We stroll through this for a good while and then head back to the car. When we\'re almost there I realize my keys are not in my pocket. After ensuring they are not on me I realize for certain that I dropped them somewhere on our 1.5km forest walk. Fuck. The sun is low in the sky. I take of my coat and start running. I explore the echidna area; nothing. I run for about ten minutes, scanning the forest floor as quickly as I can. Fuck. Just keep looking. There they are! In a spot where I stopped to shoot a roo for a few. I am so relieved. Liz and I reunite, she laughs, all is good. We drive back through the gorgeous fading sky and see many hoppers on and along the road. Into Kingscote where we eat eggplant Parmesan and drink wine at the one restaurant that is still open. To our cute hotel just down the road for a tuck in. <br><br>To the ferry and across. Our driver is lovely and teaches us about some of the local cockatoo varieties. She also recommends a nice lunch spot and winery on our way out of town called Penny\'s Hill. We head up there, taste some very nice wines, and eat Mediterranean dips, yummy potatoes, and a kimchi toastie. We pick up a few bottles and head to the Cube. There are many modern Victorian style nickel machines. The art on the ground floor is somewhat charming, with a Meow Wolf story-like quality, but mostly feels about 15 years out of date. The Dali stuff is pretty cool, but his paintings are definitely better. Wine tasting is included with our entrance so we do that and really enjoy the sav blanc and the dessert sav blanc, so we get those. Barossa Valley is two hours away so we start driving. For some reason maps has us go through a bunch of farms and some unpaved road, but it is absolutely gorgeous. We arrive at the B&B, nap, then chat with our host for a few before going out for \\"The Best Pizza in Australia\\". The place did not seem promising, however the pizzas, loaded with local German-style meats, were delicious. <br><br>Sophia made us a breakfast of fried eggs and rashers. We then proceeded to do some computer stuff and sip port for the next few hours. Over to Maggie Beer\'s farm for a cheese plate and some sav blanc. We attempt another place, but it turns out it\'s just a processing facility. We drive through many palm trees and then head to Two Hands, where we do a tasting of some strong German Shirazes. Relax for a bit. I teach Peter, Sophie\'s son, The Hall of the Mountain King on piano and then to Musque for dinner. We are too late to do the tasting menu so we order scallops, smoked salmon, smoked tomatoes caprese, buttermilk salad, fries, and a Tasmanian g&t. <br><br>Another breakfast and we\'re off. I drove for 8 hours to get us to Warrnambool, a cute town and the western tip of the Great Ocean Road. We relax for a few in the motel, then head out for Thai. We get the same thing we always get, which is Massaman Curry and Pad See Ewe. Both are delicious. We walk to the theater and watch Joker, which left us both feeling a bit let down and even a tad angry. To the hotel where we talk film theory and finish a bottle of white. <br><br>It is raining. It will all day. We hang out in Bright Bird for a few hours, drink some lovely coffee, eat a delicious shakshuka & potato hash with cauliflower puree, and do some work. To Target where Liz gets a hoodie. Drive to Childer\'s Cove, which is gorgeous, but very wet and windy. Next we head to cheese world where we get some yummy cheese and find a nice marble cheese plate. Down the GORD to London Bridge, Loch Ard Gorge, and the Twelve (seven left) Apostles. We wrap up the night in Apollo Bay at the GORD Brewhouse, where we have some beers, a nice meal of nachos & fish \'n chips, and sleep upstairs.<br><br>Our day is spent completing the GORD. First we do a waterfall hike. We snack on some jalapeno & honey cheddar. Up a steep hill for a Teddy\'s Lookout over the town and bay. We work our way up and stop by Anglesea Golf Club to do a kangaroo tour. Ian drives us through the ground of the course as we get to see scores of roo\'d boys and girls hanging out on the greens. We grab another Rebel Whopper before heading into Melbourne, dropping off the car, and having some Shiraz in the hotel. A nice older man who knows a lot about Australian water infrastructure drives us to Naked for Satan, where we discovere the kitchen is closed. We walk and discover that next door is a Mexican restaurant and bar called Little Hop, which smells delicious. Five tacos, two quesadillas, four gorditas, a beer, and a sangria later we can verify that it is, in fact, very delicious. We walk over to Above Board, a super minimalist cocktail bar with lovely bartenders and excellent drinks. <br><br>Our first stop for the day is Lune, a pastry shop recently voted the best croissant is Melbourne. We have a caccio e pepe circle, a ham & cheese croissant, and a lemon curd cruffin. They are indeed superlative. We will return tomorrow. To Dangerfield where Liz finds a cute dress and earrings with eyeballs in them. To UNIQLO for socks. We take a but to Three Bags Full where we have very nice coffees, Liz gets a potato hash with beef cheek, and I order a chorizo shakshuka. We head to the hotel to relax for a bit. We finish the red from last night and walk to Gingerboy for tartare w/creme fraiche, various very good dumplings, Korean chicken wings, and cocktails. We head back to the hotel and watch The Last Jedi.<br><br>Back to Lune for a plain croissant, a ham & cheese croissant, a pan au chocolate, an almond croissant and great coffee. We walk to Holy Moly and play 27 holes of fun, wacky, spooky mini golf, and get free visors. Next we walk to Heartbreaker to fucking good, greasy pizza and weird beer: barrel aged g&t ale and a habanero & rosewater corn lager. From there we head to the airport and fly to Sydney. I meet Liz, Gabriel, and Manav in the lounge for a few, then we head to Cho-Cho San to meet Michael and Mark for a nice Japanese dinner with cocktails and an unenthused waitor lady. It is immediately awesome to see them again and it feels like everyone is having a great time. The place is shutting down, as is the whole neighborhood, so we get a cab to a nearby Texan style salloon for beer and Pina Coladas. We are all feeling tired and everyone but me has an early morning, so we hug and part ways.<br><br>I wake up, iron Liz\'s dress, going her for a quick bite, and see her off. I proceed to clean up, fiddle on the computer, and eventually head to Cross Eatery for a burnt cauliflower with kimchi toastie and a Wattle seed cola.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-34.501490, 138.983492","From":"Oct 30, 2019","To":"Nov 12, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Adelaide, Kangaroo Island, Barossa Valley, Great Ocean Road, Melbourne, Sydney","NumberInTrip":"","One":"-33.856782, 151.215303","Two":"-34.916926, 138.608874","Three":"-36.047669, 136.756198","Four":"-35.246295, 138.550847","Five":"-34.501463, 138.983502","Six":"-38.385122, 142.490493","Seven":"-38.758727, 143.670283","Eight":"-37.815414, 144.954807","Nine":"-33.869516, 151.225307","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6"},{"City":"Izumo","Trip":"Birthplace","Id":"237","Photo":"x","Description":"At the airport McDonald\'s, I accidentally order only one hash brown and get very angry. I realize how dumb I am being and stop. We fly on a plane and ride on two buses. Then we are at Izumo-Taisha, which is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. Liz informs me that the Japanese word for October translates roughly to \'without gods\'. It is called that because in October all of the Shinto gods in Japan leave their shrines and come to Izumo-Taisha to hang out. Liz finds a beautiful little frog. Then she finds a praying mantis on the main shrine gate. Then she finds a beautiful beetle on a sign post. Were these creatures the gods in earthly forms? Yes. Now we walk in the sun and arrive at Tanakaya, a quaint restaurant which serves homemade soba in the Izumo style. They process the buckwheat with the hull included, this making the noodles darker, coarser, and earthier. The noodles are served on three trays, each with a different topping (foam, daikon, egg). Our server brings us a pot of pasta water, serves us a cup, and pours a splash of dashi in it. We get on a bus and ride through the windy mountains to the edge of the peninsula. There is another nice old shrine there so we get out and explore it. Older people here talk to us as though we speak the language. It is quite charming. We start walking towards the ocean, but Liz sees a cat, then two more, then two more. She approaches slowly. They are sunning and cleaning; they don\'t run off. We spend the next half hour sitting in the street playing with some sweet babes. The cheeky boy is especially fond of Liz. He climbs into her lap, she cradles him, and they fall in love. We walk up the mountain. Small shops are selling beautiful sea shells and blowfish with googly-eyes attached. I very nearly step on a praying mantis. We get to the lighthouse. It is white brick against a white sky. We walk along a cliff and lean out over rough, foamy, emerald ocean. We bus back to town. Liz has a headache and sleeps. I work on my resume. Two hours later we get up and head to Taste, a Brooklyn inspired restaurant. The tiny room is full, but the owner comes out and constructs a table out of saw horses for us in the parking lot. Craft beer, potato salad, fried olives, mushroom and duck salad, tuna tartar. Liz drops a piece of tuna on the ground. I consciously turn around for a few seconds. It is gone. I\'m still hungry so we get chicken wings. Liz is messaging with Kyle, who informs her that he and his friend were just nearly victims of a hate crime stabbing. He is fine, but we are shaken. Walking home, we stop into a conbini and get ice cream. Liz\'s is rich milk. Mine is sweet potato and comes in a cardboard-like cone, which quite closely resembles the look and feel of a sweet potato.<br><br>We sleep until 9:50. Checkout is at 10:00. I shave in the lobby bathroom. We walk down the canal. An old man looks at us, tells us something, and flaps his arms behind his back. He points behind a low bridge. Below the bridge is a large, white crane. It is feeding on small fish and is majestic in the shade. Into a cafe next door. The wood is dark from years of wear, the furniture is post-war. There are huge potted plants in concrete. Liz says it smells like her grandparents\' house when Hans was alive. We eat gratin, fish, and chicken. I nearly fall asleep at the table. We had intended to go to a nearby onsen town, but the bus ride costly, so we opt to go bowling instead. The building looks nearly abandoned. There are only squat toilets. The lanes are very oily and on my first throw I slip and bang my knee on the wood. I focus on my form and center of gravity. Liz and I tie the first game at 109. We both beat our scores in the second game with Liz at 120 and me at 137, which is likely my personal best. I rent ping pong paddles and look for Liz. I find her at a slot machine in the kids arcade. She wins two of three games. I eat a not-good melon pan at the airport and I fly home. Liz doesn\'t make the first flight, so she watches The Handmaid\'s Tale for three hours at the airport.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"35.433922, 132.628204","From":"Oct 5, 2019","To":"Oct 6, 2019","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/qGxbWhofwwo7hR9v6"},{"City":"Kyoto","Trip":"Final Round","Id":"236","Photo":"x","Description":"We have sushi from a plastic tray in the airport. We land outside of Osaka and take the monorail to the Expo \'70 Park. We have tickets to see the newly reopened interior of the Tower of the Sun. The inside features a zig-zagging staircase, which works its way up around the Tree of Life, which is more like and upturned root upon which are mounted animatronic (not operating, unfortunately) plaster creatures. From low to high they are meant to represent the progress of evolution of life on Earth. The gorilla\'s head is missing, leaving behind only hydraulic pumps and metal jaws. We take two trains and a bus to Ryoanji temple. It is very cool, green, and mossy. We take off our shoes and walk on soft, old wood. There is a rock feature where six large rocks are surrounded by a pond of beautifully raked pebbles. We wander the complex and find a seven-legged spider constructing a scribbly web. We get a sparkling apple and jelly drink and get on a very crowded bus heading for the center of town. We go by Kichi Kichi Omurice, not expecting to get in, but are let in. We order the classic Omurice and a beef stew. The man with purple hair puts on a fun show of making the rice. It is all yummy and we eat it very quickly. We take a bus to a food hall, where we find The Roots of All Evil - Little Evil: celery gin, black Sambuca, plum wine. Ghost Note: gin, absinthe, bonito, matcha, grapefruit, honey. Liz sees the bartender drink from the mixing spoon multiple times. We have a mediocre donut and bus back north.

The drinks are great. We walk back through the touristy area. A young guy is covering Tears in Heaven.

We walk to Koe donuts for a wasanbon and a pistachio cake donut. We continue to a nice little shop for cold brew. Northward to Aoonigiri for salmon & salmon roe, curry chicken, miso & negi, and tofu & bonito onigiri sets. The owner has a monk-like quality and the restaurant feels sacred and hushed. Next we get on a cute train, with outward facing seats, up to the mountains. We arrive at Kurama, a Tengu-inspired mountain shrine hike. We hike up in gorgeous cool weather. We hike down in the rain. We learn that Liz\'s rain jacket isn\'t actually all that water resistant. We get back to the hotel and change into what warm clothes we have. After a while we get up and walk to Cocina √ìrale for margaritas, chips & salsa, nachos and delicious tacos. We walk just a couple of minutes and return to nokishika711 for Soil & Pimp Sessions: burdock gin, black soybean bitters, whisky, tonic, herbs, soil. Silly Symphony: porcini gin, chestnut, yogurt, soda, fermented mushroom, honey, egg white, chocolate. Fly Me to the Moon: spice gin, Suze, sake, ginseng bitters, moon candy, pumpkin flake.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"35.116725, 135.766938","From":"Sep 21, 2019","To":"Sep 22, 2019","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/6tn69bRT6FWG4WQT6"},{"City":"Da Nang","Trip":"Southern Vietnam","Id":"235","Photo":"x","Description":"At 9:30 we get a call from the from desk to remind us that breakfast is closing soon. We eat. It is surprisingly good. I meditate for the first time in a few days. I fantasize about sex as a distraction from the discomfort of stillness. Our driver from last night takes us to My Son. Back-lit cattails beard rust brick rubble piles. This is a nursing home for retired buildings. Moss liver spots. The beings lean to one side. Many require support to sit upright. Some show obvious cosmetic work. All are thinning on top. Tufts of shrubbery grow from strange new nooks. They are very old. They exist now only to remind us of how life used to be. I am briefly tempted to kick one. It is cloudy, we are sweaty. There are loud, unfamiliar insects. I can hear gongs and drums in the distance. When I get to where I think the sound originated, there is nothing there. We hydrate and leave. We are dropped right into Hoi An Old Town. The sun is setting and there are hundreds of cloth lanterns out. We hit the food stalls. Banana pancake with Nutella. Vietnamese pizza, unsure what it was exactly. Sticky rice banana. We sit at a street-side cafe and have beers. A young girl tries to sell us lanterns, two times. She is very adorable and Liz decides to give her a couple of dollars. She hugs Liz and kisses her on the cheek. Liz looks ready to cry. We are very sticky and decide to have a Banh Mi and call it a night.<br><br>At breakfast a kind woman makes me a very strong coffee and gives another man the waffle I made. We take the shuttle to Old Town. The sky is old dishwasher and it\'s being wrung out over the whole of the region today. We find a Banh My stand with a long line and get it. They put at three different sauce spreads and four different types of meat on this. The bread is very french and newborn. It is the best thing we\'ve eaten in Vietnam. There are so many flavors at once and interesting changes from bite to bite. I can\'t comprehend it, but I love it. We walk through miniature lakes and rivers. We wade upstream and find a spa. We get decent foot massages. My hairy legs need about 300% more oil than Liz\'s. I meditate in the car on the way to Da Nang. Get to the hotel and relaxed. We look for the hot tub, but there isn\'t one. It\'s still quite rainy out and we are feeling a recuperative type of night so we touch good and get Indian. The lamb korma is the best I\'ve ever tasted and the chicken Tikka Masala is unique and delicious.<br><br>We finish the delicious curry cold then top it off with a mediocre hotel buffet. Hai picks us up and drives us to Ba Na Hills, a Vietnam Disneyland. He plays techno at a soft volume. We ride a very long cable car and arrive. We spend the next few hours exploring Medieval Square, Buddhism World, Big Hands Bridge, and Jules Verne Arcade. I am slightly disappointed at the absence of a Communism Cafe or Viet-Cong Village. We ride a two-person roller coaster. We eat Vietnamese doughnut balls, a sausage on a stick, and a strawberry smoothie. We wander a lot and head to the arcade. We play a Crusin\' USA type game and basketball game, which Liz does exceptionally well at. Back to the hotel for a nap. We wake and get a ride to H·∫£i S·∫£n ƒê√† N·∫µng Nh√† h√†ng B√© M·∫∑n, a point-to-your-dinner seafood hall, which appears to be quite popular with the locals. We get eight chili garlic shrimp, two big blue langoustines, ten green sauce oysters, Morning Glory, fried rice, and some beers. Afterward, we walk down the beach. There are many little crabs running around. I manage to chase one who runs sideways with his pincers up. We come back and watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.<br><br>Breakfast and face masks, so-so massages, more superlative Indian, and then we head to the airport. We fly there to HCMC, but on the flight Liz starts feeling unwell. We land and she goes to the bathroom for a while. She has diarrhea, is vomiting and is having intense stomach pains, which increase in severity. She lies on a bench in the Departure terminal. We decide not to to fly to Tokyo tonight. We decide to get a cab and a hotel, but she can\'t even stand up to walk to the car pickup. Eventually she is able to walk and we decide to go to the hospital. We get a ride and go in the local hospital first. It is pretty depressing and no one speaks English. I try filling out a form in Vietnamese. A man wearing only pants runs out yelling in pain. I see hospital beds with blood stains on them. One of the staff manages to tell me that the international clinic is actually the next building over. We go there and it is a much nicer experience immediately. A doctor very quickly diagnoses Liz as having food poisoning and prescribes her some pain and nausea medication. She comes out to the lobby where I am waiting with our bags, but he quickly calls her back again. I wait for about 40 minutes. I hear the occasional yelp of pain. She is the only person in there and I begin to worry. I eventually inquire as to what is happening. Apparently they gave Liz a cot to lie on. I find her sleeping there, but still in a lot of pain. Soon she gets up and we get a ride to a cheap airport hotel.<br><br>I walk to get water, Pocari Sweat, and McDonald\'s. She seems to be feeling considerably better and eats all of her food. She sleeps more and I meditate and look for jobs. We watch The King of Comedy and Shock Treatment, which make for a pretty fun double feature. On the plane I watch Inside Out and cry deeply.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"16.056932, 108.246375","From":"Aug 28, 2019","To":"Sep 2, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang","NumberInTrip":"","One":"15.878503, 108.331998","Two":"16.056932, 108.246375","Three":"15.996980, 107.989971","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6"},{"City":"Ho Chi Min City","Trip":"Southern Vietnam","Id":"234","Photo":"x","Description":"Getting here seemed unnecessarily stressful. I felt slighted when the bus driver charged me double fare to account for my suitcase. Realizing that the cost of two fares combined totaled about $.50 helped, a little. Traffic is chaotic. Motorcycles appear as cells in a large amoeba. Lots of coughing and hacking. The bus is clean. The driver takes off his shoes before getting into his chair. An old man is meditating in the median of a busy street. Couples are playing badminton in the park. The air is hazy like Santorini. People wear loose-fitting face masks and helmets. I stop on a bridge and record the sound of mostly motorcycles. I get in, meet Cori, and catch up. We are both quite tired so we sleep. Hours later we are up. I grab a bitter, unsweetened coffee and spicy nori from 7/11. We chat a bit, talk with Sean, and go for a walk. It is pouring, but completely dies off in less than two minutes. Our first stop is Tung I\'m Hungry for Pho Kho Ga. The noodles are dry. The woman who served them pours many condiments on top and mixes them all together. It is sweet, spicy, peanuty, and herbaceous. There is also a meat-stock soup. We talk about The Spell of the Sensuous, a few other books, and single-celled organisms. We walk again for a while. We arrive at Workshop, a Third Wave shop, and have a local espresso latte. It\'s complex and reminds me of going down on a woman. V60, passion fruit cheesecake, and pumpkin roll round it off. Young cats hang out on a motorcycle. We slowly wander back. I mediate and Cori stretches. Liz arrives. We all catch up and eat English chocolate. We get a ride to Hum, which is a vegetarian restaurant owned by the same people who run Uu Dam Chay in Hanoi. We eat loads of delicious veggies, pecan fried rice, panang tofu pucks, young banana, and doughnut balls. We wander the streets looking for either a massage or a bar. We eventually settle on Below Whisky Den. There is a group of 8 people clapping loudly and in poor sync with TLC\'s Waterfalls. We order and drink some very good stuff. Mine is whiskey forward and delicious. Liz\'s tastes like Cold Stone Cake Batter‚Ñ¢ ice cream. A guy from the Bronx plays a set of covers ranging from Johnny Cash for Jeff Buckley. He sounds good and blesses us. We are very tired.<br><br>Liz has a headache. Cori is working. I read some Douglas Adams and eat nori. I go for a walk, wander through a local market. The colors, lighting, angles, smells, and sounds overwhelm me. Raw meat is being chopped on a counter. A woman is gutting a fish. Shrimp in a bowl of water. A big rat scurrying in the dim light. Stacks of packages I can not understand. I buy coconut, which a master drains and de-meats into a bag in seconds. It starts to rain. It starts to pour. I stand in the shop and listen to it. Back. Liz is up and feeling slightly better. We eat coconut. The three of us head back out to the market. I see a woman cooking something that looks like a bright green pancake. We get one, it is coconut and pandan and delicious. We also get a fried plantain and some other fried ball. We walk through the market and see many beautiful vegetables and fruits. Shrimp are jumping out of baskets. Eggs coated in charcoal. Chicken feet. A pigs head. A cage packed full of chickens. Frogs tied together with plastic. We head to a stall and get a noodle soup with tomato, fish cake, snails, and a blood brick. The broth is pleasant. It was Bun Rieu. We find another fried plantain stand and have that. There is some fun workout equipment and we play on that for a bit. We walk to Workshop for more coffee and passion fruit cheesecake. Now to get feet massages, which is nice nice. We go by two different kitchenware stores and find some salt dishes and chopsticks. Liz found a place that looks promising called Racha, so we head there for dinner. We order some great cocktails. For food we get: charcoal tempura calamari, beef mint salad, fried silken tofu, duck shiitake dumplings, wagyu gyoza, crab lemongrass wontons, spare ribs, and beef tongue with rice crackers. It is all very yummy. Back at home we play Name That Crease‚Ñ¢ with Sean.<br><br>I wake up. It\'s 10:30. Liz had a headache in the night, but is feeling better now. I make a coffee and we snack on nori. Cori comes back from a workout and I improvise a song and dance for her return. We take our time and eventually head out. We get a delicious banana coconut drink. The massage place is full, but we make an appointment. Walk to My Banh Mi for chicken lemongrass with spicy garlic, and coconut pork with black pepper cream, plus a side of spring roll. A man, who we later presume is the owner, tells us about the origin of mole, Caesar salad and chimichangas. We look briefly and the Notre Dame and get a ride to the War Remnants Museum, which focuses on the destruction of the US in the war. We certainly caused a lot of it. We rush over to get very good massages from two very strong ladies. Back to the apartment where we swim with Cori, talk about gender, and head to Bed Nha Luv Tinh, a restaurant that Cori had recommended. Tofu with seafood, catfish in clay pot, beef with salt, duck skewer with sugar sticky rice, banana cake with coconut cream. We stay up late and talk about books, gender, and melatonin.<br><br>Goodbye to Cori and onto a bus for a tour. We ride with Nam, our guide, and ten other Europeans. There are many other tour groups, each is separated by culture. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Western. We get to the Cu-Chi tunnel area. We learn about tunnel building, strategy, and booby traps. People try getting into a small hole. We are taken to a shooting range where you can try firing an M-16 into a dirt hill. Many do. The climax of the tour is getting the chance to crawl through 100 meters of genuine Viet-Cong tunnel. I do. Lots of driving and then we are in Mekong. We have a big, many coursed lunch, which is better than I expected it to be. Now to a boat. The river is brown. This is right where the tiger scene happened in Apocalypse Now. It is very cloudy but there is no rain. We are turned away from a fishing village. We continue on the river and head towards a coconut candy factory where we taste and buy that. We ride a tuk-tuk through narrow concrete streets until we arrive at a performance area where a local group sings traditional Vietnamese songs and If You\'re Happy. I dip a piece of fruit into sugar and take a bite. It isn\'t sugar, it is salt. Liz was watching me and is cracking up now. Nam brings out a python and we hold it. On a small boat down where an old woman paddles us down a narrow Creek for a few minutes. Once we\'re out they fire up the engines and zip away. I chat with a Dutch father on the long ride back to town. At the airport. I gorge in the lounge. We arrive to Da Nang and a nice driver takes us to our hotel in Hoi An.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"10.776029, 106.705160","From":"Aug 24, 2019","To":"Aug 27, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang","NumberInTrip":"","One":"10.776029, 106.705160","Two":"10.969431, 106.497128","Three":"10.344805, 106.364799","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/boE3JhgHZkhGHbFd6"},{"City":"Sydney","Trip":"Once in a Lifetime","Id":"233","Photo":"x","Description":"I wake up to a beautiful view of Hyde Park and St. Mary\'s Cathedral. To the posh art deco lounge for a nice breakfast where I have a mishap with a tight french press plunger and spray hot, pulpy coffee over the table and Liz. She is very cool about it. Sydney is chilly and I didn\'t bring any warm stuff. We do some shopping in Uniqlo and then take a bus south to White Rabbit to see Hot Blood, a collection of interesting and disturbing art from China and Taiwan. We drink some overpriced blue milk from Two Sis. No luck with massages. We relax in the hotel for a bit. I meditate then we head up to the bar and get Aperol spritzes and snacks. From there we walk to Since I Left You where we order Little Grace: Zubrowka vodka, apple, elderflower, spice, whites; Guilty Pleasure: cognac, Pimm\'s, cacao, bitters, spice; Chile con frijoles toasty. Next onto PS40 and for a Day of the Dead: Chartreuse, maraschino, mezcal, egg, mole; Into the Wild: macadamia washed vodka, verjus, salt baked pineapple, basil. A three-minute walk and we\'re at Uncle Ming\'s. We\'re not feeling the vibe here so we leave before ordering. Instead we make our way to Frankie\'s Pizza, which has a much better vibe. We order slices of good good pizza, drink some good beer, and listen to a local band play.<br><br>We meet Sok outside a station where. She drives us up to the Blue Mountains for a day of exploration. We check out the Three Sisters and hike around there just a bit. Into Katoomba. We attempt a seemingly Hobbit-themed restaurant, but we don\'t feel like waiting for an hour to get in so we opt for a fippy chippy. Next to Wentworth Falls for some more mini hiking, bird spotting, and fall viewing. We stop by a cute street town to wander for a few and then head back to Sydney. Sok drops us off and we make for Earls Juke Joint in New Town for some delicious local sour ales. From there we walk a few doors down to Lentils as Anything for a pay-as-you-can vegan Dahl and a coconut soup. A little further on to Jacoby\'s Tiki Bar, which is a charming Twin Peaks homage (with a Black Lodge hallway) and boasts delicious drinks.<br><br>We take our time at the hotel and I eventually get the wifi working on my laptop. To Cross Cafe for white bean & kale soup, caramelized cauliflower and kimchi toastie, miso pumpkin, and some PS40 sodas. It is very good. Liz goes back to the hotel to work and I pick up some new ear studs from a nice piercing shop. I watch some old men play giant chess in the park before coming back and meditating. We drink and snack in the hotel lounge then cuddle for a little bit before I leave to catch my flight. I get a free katsu chicken sandwich meal with my priority pass and sleep for most of the flight.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-33.713105, 150.310943","From":"Aug 2, 2019","To":"Aug 5, 2019","People":"Sok","Locations":"Fiji, Sydney","NumberInTrip":"2","One":"-17.934460, 177.260068","Two":"-33.713105, 150.310943","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oepkcQ6q48zzMSGk9"},{"City":"Fiji","Trip":"Once in a Lifetime","Id":"232","Photo":"x","Description":"We eat T\'s Tantan vegan ramen at Narita then fly to Fiji. We watch Fight Club, which we find remarkably relevant. We order a nice chicken with oyster sauce at the Nadi Airport--they missed a golden opportunity by not naming it Nadi by Nature--then get a taxi to the resort. We meet some nice humans along the way. We wait in the lobby area for a what feels like too long while they get the room ready. We attempt to play chess on a board with no pawns. We try to play pool, but there are too few balls and the nets had big holes in them. Into the room and we lie down a bit. We wake up at around 5pm and head to the pool; there are no towels so we walk around a bit. We sit in the lounge for some decent cocktails. We find a hot tub so we do that for a bit. Back to the room where we order a cheese pizza and drink a bottle of bubbles. Nice times are had by all.<br><br>Buffet breakfast. The steamed buns in cardamom coconut milk are yummy and texturally very non-Western. We play chess on a giant board where each square is as long as my foot and the queen\'s crown comes up to the ticklish part of my thigh. I beat Liz, but give her some helpful tips. We head to the pool where we swim as far as the swim-up bar. We dry off in the sun, read about the formation of stars, drink more bubbles, order a pepperoni pizza, and chat with Mom & Jim. They give us a whirlwind tour of their cruise in the North Sea, their road trip around the Midwest, and Danny\'s memorial service in Middletown, CA. We just miss the sunset. To the infinity pool and more hot tub. We get smart looking and arrive at the fish restaurant apparently too close to closing because we get glares from the kitchen staff. We receive some quite good (hopefully clean) food including coconut civiche, tuna poke, seared salmon filet, and cauliflower soup. We play another game of big chess; this time in the moonlight. I win, though not as easily as before.<br><br>Buffet again for mostly coconut stuff and fries. Someone forgot to put custard in the custard donut. We receive a wildly inflated hotel bill and have to sort that out. We relax and read a bit. Kay #2 then takes us to the airport to pick up our rental car...which they didn\'t have. In fact, they didn\'t have any cars. The sweet woman tries to sort it out and manages to find an eight passenger van for us, but by now Liz and I have decided we are done with Fiji and that we\'d rather spend the rest of our time somewhere else in the world. We book some tickets to Sydney and, after dealing with some very mediocre customer service, demonstrate exemplary hedonism in the well-stocked lounge; probably our favorite part of Fiji. We get on a flight. I exhibit inhuman restraint by not taking the penne Bolognese with shaved Parmesan or the Hagen Das single serve ice cream cup.

We\'re pretty sure she doesn\'t know they are pot leaves. We get vegan sushi and also a beef rice block at the airport then catch a bus and then a ferry to get us to Naoshima. First we check out the big red pumpkin then have some long, chewy udon. We check into our hotel and fall asleep for a few hours. We get a nice latte and miss a bus so we grab a taxi to the Honmura port and where we get tickets for Art House, a collection of empty homes in the area which have been made into art exhibits. #1 Ishibashi for waterfalls and burnt cliffs. #2 Haisha for statue of liberty and laquer room. We stop by \'The Water\' to dip our feet in a nice pool. #3 Gokaisho for flower petals on tatami. #4 Kadoya for LED numbers in water. We walk to Go\'o shrine for white rocks, an underground chamber, and ice stairs coming up from the underground pool, through the ground, and up the shrine. To the bubble bike parking lot and then on a bus to Benesse House Museum for some more nice art and looking at the sky. Our favorite piece here is a wall of phrases like \'play and die\' and \'fuck and live\' written in neon. WE get another cab and find it\'s our same drive from earlier (apparently there are only two taxis on the island). We make for Naoshima I <3 Yu public bath, but get distracted by a cute mid-century Americana diner with a great smelling grill out front so we have some Cajun chicken and a tuna melt first. Into I <3 Yu for a nice bath with a big elephant sculpture. We see Buddy from the diner and chat with him for a while. It turns out he\'s good friends with Elovis Sato! Next we walk to Bar Saru for a local rice beer and a local ginger beer, which are weird and pretty good. To our tatami room for cuddles and bed.<br><br>Nice coffees from Mikazukishoten. Our barista is very friendly and gives us some stickers. We bus to Honmura and get tickets for James Turrell\'s Minamidera, which is a very dark room where you sit still for 15 minutes and perceive your eyes adjusting to the soft \'light screen\'. It is incredible. We pop into a glass ball mini gallery. Bus down to the Chichu Museum. We wait a while and drink an olive soda, which tastes like Sour Punch rope. Into Chichu: The James Turrell pieces are profound. We do Open Field twice. Monet\'s lillies are poetic and De Maria\'s ball is heavy. Down to Lee Ufan for some serious minimalism and then another bus to Miyanora. A ferry and then a train to central Okayama. To The Coffee Bar for coffee, nice ginger ale, and a partially frozen creme brulee. We relax in the hotel a bit before heading out. We walk to the river and look at the beautiful black castle. We both get real sweaty. We want to try the local style of udon and walk for a while to a place only to find it is closed for the night. We find another that looks good and eat there. I order one with spicy miso and Liz a cold one with beef, quail egg, gobo, and fried fish stick. It is all delicious. The udon is firm, chewy, and long.

Rest a bit plus nice times. We walk to a very good boba stand for an oolong with taro, milk, and boba. Then we take a bus up north to Shilin Market. It is quite bustling. We rediscover the basil and egg pancakes we loved last time and get one. After a bit we smell a stinky tofu stand and see a long line for it. Needless to say we hop in. The tofu is fried in cubes with a crispy outside and a spongy center, which perfectly sops up the funky cabbage, sweet sauce, and spicy paste in the bag. It is fantastic; even weirded and better than we\'d hoped. We stroll a bit more and then head back to the hotel. Nap a bit more and then to Draft Land for drinks. All of the cocktails are on tap; we order a South Island Fizz: Kaffir gin, falernum, lime, mangosteen mats soda; English Milk Punch: brandy, dark rum, cinnamon, apple, sugar, lime. Next round is Special: chili, rum, vinegar, whey and Hop Heads: IPA, oolong vodka, sherry, and a round of truffle fries. All are delicious and cheap. Next we walk to Bar Mood for purple potatoes, pork spare ribs, Sweet Osmanthus Blossom: Bulleit Rye, Osmanthus syrup, Carpano Dry, lemon, egg white, smoked plum and Tyrant\'s Blessing: mezcal, tea syrup, basil & lemongrass syrup, lemon, grapefruit, basil. Walk back.<br><br>A morning chat with Liz\'s family for a bit then we head to Starbucks for caffeine. We ride a bus to Yongkang and ete at our favorite soup dumpling restaurant. We order a bunch of soup dumplings plus cooked green onions, a pork roll, onion black pepper buns, and black sesame buns. Everything is incredible. Up to the contemporary art museum for some contemporary art. Back to the hotel for a shower and then across the street for massages. Mine is painful and awesome. Next we walk to Indulge for chicken consomme, chicken liver pate, romanesco stir fry, and pork. They accidentally bring us the wrong pork (which is not very good), and they are out of the one we wanted so we get chicken wings instead (which were also not very good). For drinks we sip Imperial Honeydew Cocktail: imperial honeydew tea liquor, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, cherry, spice and Lingering Autumn: rum, Osmanthus, autumn plants, shiso. Second round is Dream Big: bourbon, sour mash, Mandarin Napoleon, amaranto, black walnut, bay leaf. Grain in Ear: tequila, mango, agave, lime, orange blossom, charcoal roasted oolong beer foam. We go back to the hotel to \'lie down for just a few\' before heading out to the next bar...there will be no next bar.<br><br>We do some Father\'s Day chatting with dads and get more massages. Liz has her feet massaged and I do cupping, which is weird, painful, and oddly relieving. Onto Toasteria for halumi with pesto, hummus, and a grilled cheese with lemon caper aioli. It is very good.

At 1 we head to Hale, a vegetarian restaurant in Nishiki Market, for a yuba mushroom don set with many wonderful sides of tofu and veggies and a fermented fruit spritzer. Next to Sou Sou where we pick up a nice black and white tenugi. We walk by a shop with nice leg designs and bought matching shirts. Onto Fushimi station and to Vermilion for an Orangina and espresso drink. Into a moderately busy Fushimi Inari. Liz wants to do the whole hike. We find some charming shrines, a few friendly nekos, a sulfur cured egg, and superlative kitsune figures. We ride the train to Face House, which is a house that looks like a face and then walk to Sake Bar Yoramu, which is a small bar that serves exclusively rare and unconventional sakes. The owner is very knowledgeable and helps us to appreciate some very interesting sakes; one of which had been aged in the bottle for twenty-two years and tastes to me like a moldy french cheese. We walk home and sleep for a long time.<br><br>A lazy morning with conbini coffee and a flan crepe. We walk to Weekenders Coffee for a dark roast and a light roast cold brew. Both are excellent. Bus ride to Aonigiri, which it turns out is closed. We find a local beef curry restaurant where we eat a beef curry and a beef hash omurice. Next we begin our many hours-long stroll down the Path of Philosophy. We mostly skip the bigger temples and focus on small finds like a pretty black dragonfly, tako ni neko washi tape, cats, hydrangeas, and a mouse shrine. Back in the city we find a good and cheap antique shop where we pick up a flower vase. Onto Yasaka and then the Geisha district, which is pretty dead. We try going for Mexican food, but it is closed so we head back to the apartment for a bit to relax. We eat way too many gyoza at Chao Chao and try to go to a gin bar, but it is closed. Next we walk to steam-punky L\'Escamoteur for a Death in Provence: Absinthe, lavender, lemon, sugar and a Rossi Gin Fizz: Tanqueray, absinthe, vanilla, cream, egg, citrus, sugar. After there have a bit of difficulty finding F.S.N., a bar run by a French guy who plays old Metallica. A man at the bar compliments Liz on her \'deep voice\'. The owner is sweet and chats with us for a bit on the patio.<br><br>My tattoo peels and we head to Kiyomizudera. Off the bus and we see a sign for a raclette & coffee shop, so naturally we do that. We order a smoked chicken baguette and fries, each with cheese, and two lattes. We walk up to the temple and explore there a bit. Then we take a bus to the north east side of town where we explore a Daruma temple Liz had found when searching for Daruma temples. It is cool and we buy a Daruma. Back to get our bags and then head to the airport.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"34.967170, 135.773265","From":"Jun 8, 2019","To":"Jun 10, 2019","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/QpAgbt24Jwdm6g39A"},{"City":"Part 4","Trip":"Road Trip NZ","Id":"228","Photo":"x","Description":"Remembered Liz\'s birthday and gave her pack of film in a wrapper with a cute drawing on it. Got on the ferry and got the premium cabin again. Read some book and ate some food. Got off a few hours later in Wellington and hit the road. Grabbed a Macca after a few more hours and got to Whakatane at around 10. Chatted a bit and to bed. <br><br>Juanita was having some car trouble and we soon realized that we would have to take the van, whose name she informed us was Wakka Two Lips (not Tulip) up to Auckland. First we snacked on a yummy pork roast she had made and some pickles. Hit the road and made it up to Auckland in a few hours. Hung in the hotel for just a bit and then headed to Woodpecker, a Texas BBQ Asian grill. We had some delicious food including beer batter fries, frickles, tiger prawn dumplings, tempura eggplant, fermented chicken, and Korean-ish pork ribs. <br><br>Juanita said goodbye. We checked out and walked to Best Ugly Bagels. They were playing Jailbreak when we walked in and a charming man who reminded me of Miguel was shouting along. Had a Humdinger with hummus, tomato, and zaatar. We also had another Boss Hog and two maple iced coffees. It was all so good we then decided to get a King Kong, which featured a tasty caramelized banana whipped shmear and a chewy chocolate bagel. Walked to the hotel. Liz napped a bit and I drew what could be perceived as a figure masturbating to white noise...it was the first time I\'d drawn in a while. Watched Dead to Me and drank a bottle of red wine. Took and Uber to mini golf to find it closed. Went instead to a different mini golf, which was right next to the hotel. The theme was military, kiwi (the bird) and dinosaurs. We both played well, but I won by one point. Walked next to Amano for dinner. Stracciatella with fig, shallot, and honeycomb. Crayfish pulsante with garlic, lemon, and dill. Pappardelle with lamb ragu, olive, pangritata. Fell asleep with the lights on. <br><br>Had a nice buffet and Liz headed to work. I hung for a bit and then treated myself to a massage for being a good driver. Found a good looking place nearby and did that. Had a nice woman work my back real good. Picked up another kombucha, which made my grand total for the trip at least a score. Went downtown and stopped by AS, a nice basics store where I bought things only in black. Bought some tickets for that night for two shows as part of the NZ Comedy Fest. Headed up to the room and proceeded to eat coconut Whittaker\'s and watch BlackkKlansman. Headed to BurgerFuel, which Juanita had recommended, for an American Muscle and a vegan burger. They were quite delicious. Went to Q Theatre next to see James Acaster, who is one of the best comedians I have seen in a while and had a great set. After that we headed directly to the next show (next door) for a trio of Australian comics. Michelle Braiser mixed vocal loops and had a heartfelt piece about wanting to fuck Aladdin. Demi Lardner had dogs for shoes and ate soap. Aaron Chen didn\'t do any of that funny business, but had plenty of his own. <br><br>Kissed my lady, went to the airport, and got another bagel.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"-37.953380, 176.996689","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"Juanita","Locations":"Picton, Whakatane, Auckland","NumberInTrip":"4","One":"-41.293945, 174.775733","Two":"-37.953380, 176.996689","Three":"-36.849648, 174.763762","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7"},{"City":"Part 3","Trip":"Road Trip NZ","Id":"227","Photo":"x","Description":"We had planned to get up early and hike around Mt. Cook, but the morning was rainy and gray. We opted instead to head to High Country Salmon, a local salmon fishery, for an Eggs Benedict and a bagel, both with salmon. They were quite good. The weather was cloudy and rainy, but we decided to try our luck with Mount Cook anyway. Headed up past the sparkling blue lake and up into the valley. We hung in the car for a while and watched some Twin Peaks. No change in the weather, but we decided to do the hour return hike anyway. It was beautiful and well worth the wet toes. Started to drive back down the mountain and, as we later found out, had our multi-rib belt snap on us. Spent the next few hours figuring out what was wrong. Had some wine and food on the side of the road and slept there for the night. <br><br>Made some \'Tow?\' signs for the car, but didn\'t get any takers. Called Gary, the electrician and mechanic who came and picked up the van. He dropped us off at the backpackers hostel in Twizel and we hung in the lounge for a while to charge up and finish Twin Peaks. Chris, another charming local man, checked us into our room. We did some laundry, showered up, and relaxed for a while. Eventually we headed out to Ministry of Works for dinner. We had a very good burger, and a pizza with chicken, cream cheese, rosemary, apricot, and cashew. I had a nice local pale ale while Liz had first an apple crumble cider and then an apple rhubarb cider, both of which were quite good. <br><br>Checked out. Chris offered to drive us up to High Country Salmon where we started with coffee and a caramel bar and then had salmon nachos and a salmon Thai curry. It was very crowded with tour groups. Walked back to town and found some very good looking mushrooms along the way. Stopped into poppies cafe to warm up a bit and have another coffee. Stayed by the fire quite a while and had a honey banana smoothie. Found out we wouldn\'t be getting the car today so we booked another night at the hostel and relaxed a bit. Wrote some postcards and picked up groceries. Dinner was yogurt roasted cauliflower with pesto pasta. We were too tired to watch a movie. <br><br>The car was ready around 10:30. We got on the road then and headed through the very beautiful Lindus Pass, which featured golden rolling hills backed by craggy snow-topped mountains. Headed next to lakes Hawea and Wanaka. The glacial color was not as pronounced as it was in the Twizel area lakes, but there were some hints of emerald and jade. Made it to the Cardrona hotel next where we had popcorn squid, frickles, lamb skewers, and garlic bread. Caught sunset hitting a large mountain just as we came into view of the Wakatipu Basin with Queenstown at the far end of it. Had a quick stop in the revamped mining town, Arrowtown, just as the light was fading. Pulled into our camper spot in Queenstown just after dark. Did some grocery shopping and decided to snack and watch Picnic at Hanging Rock rather than venture into town for fish & chips. <br><br>Woke up at 6:00 and walked into town to catch our coach for our Doubtful Sound tour. Drove down Lake Wakatipu and through a very lovely glacial valley. Got off at Manapouri where we took our first boat from one end of the lake to the other. Took another coach through the steep and winding mountains to get to the tip of Doubtful Sound, where we caught our second boat. Cruised through the sound and learned much about the local history, flora, and fauna. Where the sound met the Tazman sea we stopped and said hello to the seal colony. Went back in for a bit and then turned off the engines. The captain made a vague \'no promises\' about seeing something special. About a minute later we saw a stirring in the water about 200m away. We began to see fins and before long we had about fifteen bottle nose dolphin friends playing around and under the ship. They showed us their tummies. Finished the boats and did the transportation in reverse. Back in Queenstown we headed to Blue Kanu and had a local IPA and essentially a strawberry pina colada to drink. For food we had pork ribs, black pepper venison, and kung pao duck nachos. Then a ginger colada. Bed bed. <br><br>Nice wake up times. Bought some cold brew concentrate and milk and finished off the delicious cereal. Cleaned up. Walked around the downtown a bit. Liz bought a nice jade necklace for her mum. We took the gondola up the mountain and did a couple of luge rides. Hiked up the Ben Lomond trail for a bit and found some incredible mushrooms. Headed to Erik\'s Fish & Chips for that. Next off to Fergburger for one of those. Drove for quite a few hours, listened to some great music like Houses of the Holy, Madness, and Les Paul & Mary Ford. Camped out in the same spot outside of Christchurch that we had done about a week prior. <br><br>Sat in the sun and read. It was lovely. A chatty forest ranger and I shot the breeze a while. Back to C1espresso for another lamb empanada, more coconut milk coffees, a cheesy pastry, and a savory muffin with butter. Hit the road and drove a while. Stopped in Kaikoura upon the recommendation of a woman in Queenstown. It was pretty and the beach was very stony. Wandered there a bit, found some very smooth stones, and got back on the road. Got to our campsite just outside of Picton and nabbed the last of twelve spots. Watched The Seventh Victim, an almost shockingly bad and boring film about a satanic cult with supposed homoerotic overtones.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-45.025900, 168.660436","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Mt.

Back to Best Ugly where we had a tuna melt and a chicken sandwich; both were stellar. Next we headed to the ferry terminal and took the three-hour ride to Picton, on the south island. Other than the jerk man who lied to me about his \'friends\' coming so as to not have to share his seats with us, it was pretty uneventful. Landed and were immediately in awe of how beautiful everything was. It wasn\'t too dissimilar from the north island, but the mountains were taller and the colors were more autumnal. Started heading south first trough some mountain passes, which had the softest fog lying gently upon them, and then down the coast. After a while we pulled over to check out the beach and snack a bit. We continued our five-hour drive south. It was pretty much non-stop gorgeous. We saw many seals playing on the rocks and in the water as we drove. Liz wanted to stay in a hotel so we did that in Christchurch. Got to our room, did some sink laundry, showered, and headed to dinner at Little High, a hip food stall hall. We had some nice local beers, a vegan burger with coconut bacon, very good chips with aioli/bbq sauce, and a pizza with cauliflower cheese sauce and fried capers. Back and to bed. <br><br>Headed to C1espresso for nice coffee and a lamb empanada. Played some Monster Bash pinball afterward where Liz got a score of 51 million. Drove towards Akaroa and we stunned again by the continuous and ever developing beauty. We stopped by the side of a lake and had some snacks. A big duck greeted us and basically squacked at us until (and past) when we fed it after we were finished eating. A few times it walked on to our towel and we had to shoo it away. Drove up some lovely mountains and Skyped with Liz\'s parents near the summit. Down the other side and into Akaroa. Parked by French Bay and Skyped with Mom and Jim. Explored the cute, very French influenced, town for a bit. Began driving up a very steep and very beautiful mountain toward the outer coast, but soon there was signage warning against camper vans from taking that route. We stayed at the top of the hill, which overlooked Akaroa, and caught an incredible sunset. Drove back to Christchurch and went back to Little High for dinner. We had a roasted broccoli from Bacon Brothers plus a spicy pepperoni pizza and a huge poutine from the pizza place. Everything was delicious. Drove to a campground just outside of the city and called it a night. <br><br>Began driving towards Mt Sunday, a.k.a. Edoras. All went well until about 20km from the site we came upon a very bumpy gravel road. We decided to continue through it, but I was a bit worried about the van falling apart. The entire area was basically Rohan, with rolling golden hills near to us and craggy snowy peaks in the distance. Made it to the parking lot for the hike, which was almost 2km each way. We we\'re in awe at the beauty throughout the hike. The water we had to walk through at a few points looked as though it has just melted off of a glacier. We hiked the quaint mountain; I was surprised at how small the summit was. You could hardly fit a single hall at the top let alone a whole town. It was windy and certainly looked like it belonged in a film. I left my sunglasses at the top. On accident. Began the longish drive to Late Taroko. We pulled up to the lake just after the sun dipped below the mountains, but we had about a half an hour to walk around and appreciate the views of the lake and mountains. From there we headed to the campground near the bottom of lake Pukaki. We parked the van, got out, looked up to the sky and we were both immediately in awe at how clear the stars were. The Milky Way was clearly visible and the entire sky was full of twinkling dots. We took some silly long exposure shots. Then we had some red wine with bread, cheese, and pate. Read for a bit and then tucked in.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"-43.535178, 172.640786","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Wellington, Christchurch, Mt.

Found someone to pay me back and got it done right. Bus to Manukau where we ate Indian food in a mall. Finished the ride to Rotorua and picked up the van. Dusted off the spider webs and did some practice driving around the neighborhood a bit. It went well so we headed to Warehouse and Countdown to stock up on supplies. Then we got gas, tidied up a bit and headed to dinner. Liz found Atticus Finch, where we ate roasted cauliflower with Dahl, coconut yogurt, & coriander; roasted greens, cashew cream, preserved lemon, quinoa & cumin crisps; lamb rump, veggies, tapenade, & feta creme. Parked on the street neat Lake Rotorua and settled in for the night. It was a bit chilly, but we slept well. <br><br>Got up and went to Epicurian downtown for some coffee. Bought a sourdough baguette and some incredible cheese from a passionate Italian man from the farmers market. Drove around the lake and found a nice grassy spot for a picnic. Liz napped a bit and I read. Got to Waitomo and did the Glowworm Cave tour. It was only about an hour long, but the cave was wondrous and the worms, which are actually fungus gnat larvae, were very mesmerizing. Checked into to our camping spot for the night and relaxed a bit. Headed back to the caves for the Ruakuri Cave tour. There were only four of us plus the guide, Demi, who was very cool and informative. She was happy to let me take all the long exposure shots my heart desired; well, a reasonable amount anyway. We wandered through an expansive and stunning cave system for about two hours. We found more worms, pupa, and a fly. We met tubers. We saw some stunning limestone formations. Demi mentioned a nearby bushwalk that was great at night so after the tour finished we checked that out. Saw more glowworms, a loud waterfall, and some scary spiders. Came back to the hostel and made a dinner of beans & fried egg on toast, ramen noodles with Piri Piri tuna, the rest of our farmers market cheese, and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Showered and worked on computers for a bit before heading to bed. The temperature was perfect and the drizzle of the rain made for a lovely sleep. <br><br>Had some muesli with milk and hit the road. It was a day of much driving and a good bit of rain too. Had a Macca lunch and, eight hours or so after beginning our drive, we pulled into Wellington. Went downtown and ate dinner at Chow, a mostly vegetarian, pan-Asian restaurant, where we had some nice, though unremarkable, small plates. Headed to a marina parking lot/camp site and settled in. Watched some twin peaks. <br><br>Headed back downtown and got Best Ugly Bagels. Maple syrup iced coffee, poppy with cheese, and bacon, cheddar, egg, rocket sauce on sesame. Walked to Leeds Street Bakery to pick up some sourdough and have a salted caramel cookie. It was rainy out so we headed into Milk Crate and had an iced coffee. Got a parking ticket. Back to Milk Crate and had a hot ginger drink. Wandered the downtown area some more and killed time looking in a bookshop and a record store. We were planning on going to get tacos for lunch, but when we arrived we were not feeling enticed. We were, however, feeling quite enticed by the Malaysian pace right next door. We ordered some satay, a veggie curry, and the most incredible roti bread I\'ve ever tasted. It was lightly salty and also sweet. It was hot and chewy, while being just a bit crispy too. Headed to Miramar peninsula for the Weta tour, which included a miniatures tour for the new Thunderbirds Are Go television show and also the Weta Cave tour, which gave a glimpse into the variety of work that Weta does. It was quite cool, though less LOTR focused than I was hoping for. We drove along the coast through the evening fog until we reached the airport. We did not have a flight, but we were hoping to see the Gollum statue in the terminal. Inside we learned that they had taken it down, but we did see Smaug\'s head and Gandalf riding on Gwaihir. Next we stopped at a grocery store to pick up hummus, cheese, and salami for dinner. We first parked in the same camper lot as the prior night, but I became nervous about getting a fine‚Äîwe were not technically eligible to stay in that lot. As we left we saw a park ranger who I am pretty sure was checking vehicles. We tried parking along the side of the road, but it turned out to be quite a busy road and was a bit scary. In the end, we tried our luck back at the camper park and ate and slept in the car.","WindowPlacement":"l","LatLng":"-41.293945, 174.775733","From":"Apr 19, 2019","To":"May 8, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo, Wellington","NumberInTrip":"1","One":"-37.006683, 174.784614","Two":"-38.145085, 176.248911","Three":"-38.267987, 175.078463","Four":"-41.293945, 174.775733","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7"},{"City":"Seoul","Trip":"Second","Id":"224","Photo":"x","Description":"Took a cab to the hotel and slept for a while.

We had good kimchi, nice soup, a big tray of dak galbi with cheese and various types of rice cake, fried rice and soju. Then we headed to Alice, where we drank barley water. Amuse bouche: white wine, orange, hibiscus. Reflection: .cacao nib scotch, lapsang tincture, amaro vermouth. Teddy Picker: banana rum, cold brew, Sherry. Next door basically to Le Chamber. Hello Seoul: soju, burnt rice, egg white, cinnamon. The Botanist: Gin, butterfly pea syrup, lavender, lemon, egg white. Bed.<br><br>Had a hotel breakfast and relaxed a while. Took a bus towards Insadon, but it changed directions and we got off in a different area. Fortunately, we were right by Gwangjang market and went inside. Ate a pork pancake. Went in a restaurant where we drank Chestnut beer and had. Walked around that area a bit and got a saltef butter caramel shake from Shake Shack. Took a bus back to Gamgnam and headed to Keeper for I ____ it: Ardbeg, passion fruit, lavender, agave. Marscapone Gin Fizz: gin, cheese powder, vanilla, double cream. He also gave us a White Rabbit (named by Liz): kombucha, carrot juice, white whiskey, birch syrup. Also they gave us \'girl drink\' shots on the house for posing in an Instagram photo for them. Home and Twin Peaks.<br><br>Breakfast and Twin Peaks. Changed hotels. Walked by City Hall and down the canal street until we hit Insadong. Egg cornbread. Bugolgi pretzel roll. Wandered the street and were left a bit uninspired. Tried to find good coffee, but settled on Starbucks. Took a bus to the Charles H bar. Old Crawford Punch: Jamaican rum, Cuban rum, mango, house chai, Curry leaves, clarified milk. Midnight Zombie: Caribbean rum, Genever, Calvados, passion fruit, cinnamon, lemon, dry sherry, absinthe. Headed back to the hotel and met Manav and Kartik for happy hour. Tried to find the fish stew alley, but apparently it was closed on Mondays. We did find a nice street stall where we had some rice cakes, veggie gyoza, and a chicken/onion skewer. Walked some more and came upon a fried chicken alley. Picked a place and had fried dried fish, a seafood pancake, good fried chicken and beer. The boys called it a night and we went to Marque D\'Amour. The space was well designed and featured many peacock busts that blended into the ceiling decor. First we had a sweet welcome drink. Then a Soft Rain: Cocchi Americano, sherry, lime, patchouli. Dark Flowers: Diplomatico, sherry, fernet, melon. Both were quite good. From chatting to our bartender we learned he was very good at flare bartending, but that he wasn\'t allowed to do it here. We asked him what types of flare drinks were common he made us something called a peach crush. As we were paying, he also made us all shots of whiskey sours. Lastly, they gave us two tickets to a Picasso exhibit at a local museum. Being nice to people has its perks.<br><br>Had breakfast with Liz and then she went to work. I had trouble getting my computer online. I headed out to the market again and found the fish stew alley. After an involved process of picking all of the tiny bones out I was able to enjoy the lovely and spicy dish. Took a bus to the museum. The Cubism exhibit was pretty cool, though not very large‚ÄîI was through the whole thing in a little over 20 min. Took a while getting back to the hotel, but made it in time for lounge happy hour drinks and dinner. Met Liz and her colleagues out at a chicken and beer place for Tom\'s going away do.

On Saturday, we awoke early, had a bit of trouble getting our JR Passes, and barely caught our train to Gunma. Made it there and then caught the ryokan shuttle bus for a winding, 45-minute drive through the mountains to the resort. Checked in and hung in our lovely room. Napped for a bit and then headed to the indoor onsen to wash. After that we walked the outdoor path to the main onsens, which were outside. There was snow all over the ground and it was actively snowing. After a couple of minutes we arrived at the onsen area, which consisted of three large pools all sat along the river. We went into the first pool. For as cold as it was outisde (about -3C), once we were in the toasty spring water we felt amazing. The pool could have easily held over 200 people, but probably only had about 20 at the moment. The outdoor pools were mixed gender. The women were all given \'bathing dresses\' while the men feigned modesty by holding small towels over their appendages when they got up to walk. It began snowing more heavily, but we stayed in for quite a while to take in the view. Eventually, we heade back to the room and watched some Charlie Chaplin videos. I gave Liz some very nice chocolate I had bought the previous day in Tokyo. At 6pm we went to the ryokan restaurant for our kaiseki dinner where we were served pickles, sashimi, shrimp, tofu, salted river fish, tori nabe, broccoli & mushroom cream soup, umeboshi with apricot, and fresh fruit with whipped cream. Though it was still quite early, we were both so wiped after dinner that we went straight to bed. <br><br>Awoke and had a decent buffet breakfast. Spent the day combining snacking on chocolate and red wine, touching, watching Twin Peaks, eating ice cream, and hanging in the onsen (both indoor and outdoor). At 6pm we again went to the kaiseki restaurant for a similar meal, with slight variations in meats and preparations. This time we had mackrel, a beef nabe, and salmon sashimi. All were incredible. Finished twin peaks and slept for a bit. At around 9:30 we headed back out to the onsen (they are 24hr) for a dip in the dark. It was wonderful and we stayed out there for about an hour. <br><br>Breakfast again and checked out early to catch the bus back into town. A woman sitting behind Liz on the bus became sick and, fortunately, had a bag handy. When we got off Liz also got sick. Though it was cold and we were tired we still decided to head to Takasaki as it was on the way back and free as part of our JR pass. We did so to visit Sh≈çrinzan Daruma-ji Temple, which is home to Daruama dolls. We visited the temple and saw many, many darumas. We bought ourselves a mid-sized white one, which makes our current collection three. From there we headed home where I made a nice dinner of fermented tomato water shrimp with a dessert of fermented banana, marscapone, and manuka honey filo wraps. It was a beautiful weekend.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"36.846597, 139.047628","From":"Feb 9, 2019","To":"Feb 11, 2019","People":"","Locations":"Takaragawa, Takasaki","NumberInTrip":"1","One":"36.846597, 139.047628","Two":"36.329816, 138.957278","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/6fyxcKr47fiZ3jfGA"},{"City":"Hakone","Trip":"Revisiting","Id":"222","Photo":"x","Description":"Played with fermented bananas and took our time getting to the Odakyu line. Stopped in Odawara to check out the castle. As we were walking to the castle a nice woman started chatting with us and invited us to a prayer ceremony. We politely declined and proceeded to check out the castle. Headed back to the station where we picked up some pork & shrimp dumplings and a few maki. Took a switch-backing train the rest of the way into town. Headed straight to the Hakone Open Air Museum, which we explored for a few hours. We love many of the pieces, the layout of the park, and especially the Picasso museum! Took the train one more stop to Gora and checked into the lovely Hakone Tent, which is a charming hostel/hotel. Took a dip in the private cedar onsen which felt very nice and was quite hot. Had a fruit tea in the kitchen then started walking to the brewery. On the way we saw a meowing cat in front of a conbini. We bought a can of cat food to give it, but right as we opened the can a cat grandma walked by and said hi to the cat; they proceeded to walk off together. We continued walking with the open can of food and after a minute came upon another meowing cat who seemed to appreciate the unexpected dinner. Got to the posh restaurant/brewery, had some beers with grilled shishito, crispy rice, and aburi salmon. Came back to the hotel. Had some hot sake and a great miso cream pizza. To nice Japanese women sat at our table and we chatted for a bit. Back to the room for some nice times and sleep.<br><br>Hit the onsen again, had a nice breakfast where we chatted with a French woman, and had more nice times again. Took the cable car up the mountain and then the ropeway back down. Took some very nice pictures of Fuji and got on the boat. Read some Princess Bride and got off at Motohakone. Waited a while for some yummy pastries and walked along the water. Took a bus to Hakone Yumoto. Wandered around there and bough some local citrus chu-hais. Back in Odawara, we were immediately approached by three women who seemed very interested in what we were about to do. When we said we were just heading to the grocery store, they immediately lost interest.

Watched the Lego Batman movie on the plane and ate a potato omelette. Got a Grab to the Four Points and got early check in because of Liz\'s platinum status. Slept, made a French press, and hung a bit. Got a ride to Atlas, a very incredible bar in one of the most stunning buildings we\'ve ever seen. It is done in an elaborate art deco style and is referred to by locals as \'The Batman Building\'. We ate fries with horseradish bacon mayo; pinxos with carrot, dill, and marinated anchovies; and a lobster roll with Marie rose dressing. We drank a Nude On a Terrace: Venezuelan dark rum, Italian bittersweet liqueur, citrus, agave, hibiscus. Louis Cartier: Genever, apple cider reduction, dill vermouth, lemon, gold. Walked around the gorgeous building and visited an abstract art exhibit on the third floor. Walked outside for a few and came across an early print advertising exhibition at the library. Took a bus to Manhattan, a fancy cocktail bar. Barrel-aged Aviation: Roku, Luxardo, lemon, Tempus Fugit violettes. Switchel: Jamaican rum, Cocchi Rossa, blueberry balsamic, Ferrand Dry Curacao, Amaro Montenegro, lemon. The bartender, Sophie, was lovely and gave us a tour of of the casks and ingredients store.

Watched 2001: A Space Odyssey in the room. Finished a month old sandwich. Lazed a bit and then headed to Dapper. Had some nice cold coffees and read Harlan Ellison. Next to Amoy St hawker market. First we had prawn mee, a spicy dry noodle dish with prawn and crackling. Next we had fried kway teow, which, as far as we can tell was basically a delicious clam and sausage pad see eew. Operation Dagger\'s door was locked, so we headed to Native next. Sparkling sake aperitif. Peranakan: Jackfruit rum, laksa leaves, goat\'s milk, candlenut, gula melaka. Pineapple Arrack: Ceylon arrack, old coconuts, pineapple skin, Sri Lankan spice. Young-wi, our bartender, was especially lovely.

Cheddar: Ocho Anejo tequila, P/X Sherry, spiced pear, Black Cow cheddar. Sous vide fries. Walked back to the hotel. On the way we passed a building where about 30 rats had made a playground in-between a wall and decorative grate which gave the viewer a similar effect as looking at an ant farm, but for rats. The wall was a well-lighted facade feature of a posh building, which made the event especially entertaining for Liz and I. A security guard came by to see why the two of us were so enthralled with this wall and also found the need to document the experience.<br><br>Chatted with Mom for a bit and had a big buffet breakfast. Checked out at 2pm and headed to the National Museum of Singapore for a Polaroid exhibit and a quick walk through the history museum. Headed to Operation Dagger where Ash treated us to a smoked banana kombucha and a taste of the Not a Margarita: pea husk, smoked agave, passion fruit vinegar, salty fingers. We ate sourdough with burnt butter, peas and ricotta on toast, and steak tartar. We drank Banana Split: coconut blossom, lacto-fermented banana, sawtooth coriander.

Eventually we headed out for dinner and drinks at R&D Cocktail Lab where we ate sweet potato fries dipped in truffle cheese sauce and savory fried chicken. For drinks we had Search for Pleasure (cynar, punt y mes, lemon, orange bitters); a Hibiscus Fizz, a Hot Buttered Rum, and a hojicha Old Fashioned.<br><br>I grabbed coffee, red dragon fruit, and some pastries from the market before we hopped on the bus towards Jiufen. Got there. Wandered through adorable, crowded streets. Almost had a pot of tea, but for >$20, we thought better of it. Snacked on grilled eringi, Taiwanese sausage, tofu, and ice cream mochi. Back to town and to Yongkang Beef Noodles for the eponymous dish, which was nice and underwhelming. We were about to call it an early night, but we happened to be near Alchemy, so we went in for a drink. Milk Punch: cognac, dark rum, milk, vanilla, Angostura. Heart of Aztec: tequila, pineapple, cacao, honey, lime juice, brulee lavender buds.<br><br>Up early for a bus and train ride to Hualien. Tried our luck at finding a scooter rental place that would rent to us (most only rent to locals) and got one on our third try. It was perfect weather. We drove through town, then along a highway - with it\'s own scooter lane - and into Taroko Gorge. We spent a few hours cruising up into the mountains, checking out temples, and taking in the unreal sizes, shapes, and colors. Made it back into town right before sunset and caught a train back to Taipei. Liz had to work a bit so we hung at a Starbucks and then at a Mos Burger, where we had a rice bun wagyu burger. Hit the Raohe night market near Songshan and then got a ride to Ounce. Sensation: gin, marashino, lime, mint. 1864: mezcal, vermouth, aperol, campari, mole bitters, orange.<br><br>I picked up a persimmon and some delicious cherry tomatoes for breakfast. We were very lazy and took a long time to get moving. We checked out of that and into a new hotel. There we relaxed some more. We eventually headed down to Yongkang Street again and went to Jin Ji Yuan. We had a yummy pork roll, which was reminiscent of an English sausage roll. Then we had pork soup dumplings and another kind which had a shrimp on top. It was all incredible and quite cheap. We walked south and wandered around Shida night market before heading up to Smoothie House for a sugar overload in the form of a mountain of shaved ice topped with raspberry, strawberry, mango, and strawberry ice cream. It also came with a side of custard. We opted for a quiet night in and a movie, though we ended up just falling asleep.<br><br>Another lazy morning of coffee and tomatoes. Moved to a new hotel and went to Woo for lunch and cocktails. Food was a bacon cheeseburger and Buffalo wings with dill sour cream. Drinks were Fancy 75: Tanqueray, Pavan, grapes, lychee puree, lemon juice, sparkling wine. Figgy Fizz: housemade fig bourbon, honey, teapot bitters, Thai tea soda. To Ximen. Walked a bit.

Headed back to the hotel and did a late viewing of Forbidden Planet.<br><br>Hotel breakfast and a bit of a sleep in. Went to O\'Time for a syphon Guatemalan and a sea salt coffee. Wandered around Zhongshan and stumbled across a Mikeller location. We had an incredible local sour ale and a saison/lambic blend with s broccoli salad.

Uber to Pier 2. Pretty sculptures and cosplay people were abound. Pet some cats and had Gong Cha boba (brown sugar pearl latte). To the food market for incredible garlic lobster, dark sauce and onion scallops, and salted grilled shrimp. Bought some massage tools. Back at the hotel we ate Pringles, drank beer, and gave massages.<br><br>Had some weird breakfast in the hotel. A woman was playing a bluesy, repetitive version of Fly Me to the Moon. Took a train to Tainan, had a boba sugar milk, and checked into our tree house hotel. Hung there a while and then headed out to explore the town. Found a place that specialized in a rice porridge with pork and shiitake. There we also had a nice dumpling soup and pork with sauteed greens. Wandered some very charming streets and found many cats, great architecture, ornate temples, and interesting street art. Headed towards Shennong Street when we passed a cafe that had many cats inside. We went in, played with some cats, had a huge rose milk tea and a creamy boba toast. They also treated us to an incredible cr√®me br√ªl√©e cheesecake. Down Shennong where I bought a nice vegan leather wallet then headed back to the hotel for a bit. Headed to The Checkered Record Club. There was a wait so we headed to a small food stalls serving incredible danzai (noodles in broth with ground pork, shrimp, and a brown egg). Back to TCRC for a tequila, orange juice, and elderflower drink for Liz and a mezcal, umeshu, pineapple, and black pepper drink for me. Back to the hotel where Liz had a long night of work. <br><br>Liz had a work call so I wandered the city a bit in search of a danbing (tortilla egg wrap). Found an awesome one at a market right next to the hotel and brought them back for Liz. Cleaned up then headed to the station to catch a high-speed train to Taipei.

Woke up and walked to Inasayama where we took a ropeway to the top and enjoyed a magical sunset follow by pretty glittering lights. Walked back to town and took the trolley downtown. Had a bad Singapore Sling in a charming antiquated CD (music) bar. Wandered and found a cool looking tiny bar with an eyeball on the door, but we\'re turned away by the trans probable racist tender. Went to a sushi place that looked nice. A lovely man and woman at the counter translated for us that we would need to wait about twenty minutes. About six minutes later they came out and apologized for taking so long, then gave us their seats and also bought us possibly the best chutoro we\'ve ever had. On top of that we had some incredible ika, ebi, tamago, uni, aburi saba, anago, and local sake. We enjoyed it so much Liz recommend we book reservations to come back again the next night so we did. <br><br> Headed to NGS Coffee for a delicious iced chestnut latte and a hot chestnut hojicha latte. We were a bit disappointed to find our tour boat would not land on Gunkanjima because of typhoon damage, but we did the cruise anyway (as they wouldn\'t give us a refund). It was pretty awesome to see. Went through Glover Garden and saw a church. We had a short rest in the hotel and then took a train to Konagaicho; a small town that has fruit shaped bus stops. Saw a few of them until it got dark and took the train back to the sushi restaurant. Had a whole bunch of lovely sushi. A weird older man came in and left before too long. A sweet Japanese couple bought us an akadashi miso soup. We chatted with them a bit and, before we parted, they invited us to join them for breakfast the next morning. <br><br> Got picked up by Satoshi and Ikuko. They drove us to the port fish market for a stellar and very reasonably priced kaisendon breakfast. They dropped us off at the Peace Park where there were many tourists. We then walked to the hypocenter park where we heard school children singing to the monolith. Next to the Atonic Bomb Museum. Had another chestnut coffee from NGS Coffee then headed downtown to wander, look for neko-ni-takos, and look at a pretty bridge. At a pork bun and some delicious soup dumplings.

Saw a very cool art deco building mixed in with the geisha houses. Headed back to the hotel and grabbed some conbini food on the way. We both fell immediately asleep. Later I checked out the onsen where I sat outside (on the roof of a 14 story building) in a very hot pool and let the rain drizzle on me. It was nice. <br><br>Watched some Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and ate melted ice cream. Went to the museum, but they wouldn\'t let us take bags in so we said fuck it and went to a shrine where we bought some more inari statues.

Liz got business and had some nice food. I had egg salad on a hot dog bun and watched part of Blade Runner 2049. Landed and took an hour long can ride into the city for $20. Checked into our hotel. We were both wiped so we napped for an hour. We were still wiped so we kept sleeping a while. Got up and went to the metro station. Took the train to Hongdae. It was a cute, lively area with interesting architecture, lots of restaurants, and many people out on the street. It felt like a much larger version of Cat Street in Harajuku. In many ways, Seoul immediately felt like a more laid back version of Tokyo. That being said, we found ourselves using the work \'brusk\' often when describing interactions with the locals. We went into a beauty shop and bought many face masks and also foot masks. Walked on a bit and had nice chicken skewers from a street stall. On one street watched people play a carnival style balloon dart game, some teenage kids practicing their dance moves, and people doing street karaoke. More beauty shops, brutalist architecture, and Danish mid-century furniture. Stopped into a grill restaurant for pork tripe with belly meat and a strong, smooth soju. Then we headed to Bar d.still where I had a BCG (beet, cherry, grape) that was nice, though a little flat. Liz had a Wild Style with gin, lemon, egg white, and Galliano. Took a cheap cab back. <br><br> Took our time getting up. Ate a nice buffet breakfast. Watched some End of the F***ing World. Chatted with Scott for a few. Moved to the posh Plaza hotel after watching some Mongolian singers. They upgraded us to a very nice room. Went to the club and had some snacks. Walked through some palace grounds and visited a modern & contemporary art museum. There were some nice pieces and we mostly preferred the abstract stuff. Bought some more face masks and headed south to Maple Tree House for grapefruit soju, and Korean BBQ including: miso, kimchi, pork jowl, marinated pork collar, and a nice beef striploin. Took a bus back and went to bed. <br><br> Had breakfast in the club lounge. Hung out in the hotel for a while while Liz prepped for her meeting later in the day. We met Yeo Kwang in the lobby. He was so sweet and seemed genuinely so happy to see us. We headed to a great chicken soup restaurant where we spent the next hour catching up. The food was great, though I lost my appetite slightly when an old woman sat down beind us and proceeded to make disgusting snorting and spitting sounds for the next thirty minutes. I later asked Yeo Kwang if that was a normal behavior and he said it was definitely not! We said goodbye to Liz, grabbed a coffee, and headed towards Gyeongbokgung, the ancient royal palace. We spent a while wandering the grounds, he taught me a bit about Korean hihstory, and we discussed music therapy ideas. I saw him off and began heading back to the hotel, when I notice I was right next to the Korean Contemporary History Museum. I went in and spent the next hour and a half learning about the past 150 years in this peninsula. It was pouring when I left, but I really wanted to see the comfort women statue outside the Japan Embassy so I walked over to that. There was a guard watching the statue, to presumably discourage vandalism. I bought a few tops from Uniqlo, picked up some snacks for later, and headed back to the hotel. I quickly went up to the club for happy hour where I had some nice vegetable lasagne and taught the attendants how to make a Negroni. Liz surprised me after a few and we snacked and drank some more together. We headed back and she immediately fell asleep. <br><br> I worked on my video game for a while. Then I drank a bottle of soju and looked at abstract art. I convinced a reluctant cab driver to take me to a mediocre burger restaurant. Next I took a bus back downtown to get my bag and meet my Liz.

Landed and caught a bus to Ishigaki City. To the hotel and relaxed for a bit. Got up, ate a delicious burger from a stand down the street that is connected to a yakiniku restaurant, and headed to the port to catch a bus to a beach. We met a lovely, sassy woman at the info counter who informed us that it was way too late in the day to try to catch a bus to the beach and also that Ishigaki is renowned for the beef from the cattle raised there. She recommended we visit the island\'s oldest temple and a nearby garden, which we then did. The temple was old and the garden was serene, from the front at least. We then walked to the cute town shopping area where Liz got a pineapple popsicle and a drunk man asked me some questions. Came upon a live music and dance performance, which we watched for a few. Then we relaxed in the hotel and watched some OITNB. At one point I went to Family Mart to get a taco rice maki, Pringles, and some very delicious pineapple-shikuwasa beer.<br><br>Took our time getting up the next morning. Had some chanpuru and Blue Seal ice cream for breakfast. Checked out and caught a local bus up to Kabira Bay. Walked down to the beach. The water varied in shades from deep blue, to seafoam green, to emerald. There were a few glass-bottom boats docked along the beach which were regularly ferrying people to a nearby reef. We walked down the beach for a few minutes and found a shady spot under a steep bank. We stayed there for a few hours while we slept, read, explored the sea life, and I got sunburnt. We saw hundreds of hermit crabs, some sea cucumbers, snails, pretty blue fish, and a big starfish. Headed back up to a restaurant where we had a beef croquette, a soba dish, a beer, and then a soft serve. Wandered around the park area and then stopped by a local awamori distillery where we picked up a bottle. Caught the bus down to Fusaki Beach, which we had to walk through a resort to arrive at. The water was protected by nets and lifeguards because of the many jellyfish that live in the waters. We swam in the warm, salty undulations and lay on the beach until the sun dipped below the clouds for the evening. We then took a bus back into town, checked into our new hotel, and took showers. Walked down to Ishigaki cattle Maru, where we had some local yakiniku, hot-stone bibimbap, and sours. We had picked up some more of the pineapple-shikuwasa beers and were planning on watching more OITNB, but we were both so tired we came back and fell immediately asleep.<br><br>Woke up ten and half hours later. Had some coffee, Spam onigiri, and beers and watched an episode. Checked out and took a bus to the ANA resort hotel beach. It was quite hot and neither of us were really feeling this beach, which had many kids running around, so we caught another bus a little while later and hung at the airport instead. We ate a Spam-don and one last goya chanpuru before catching a flight back to Tokyo, where we had quite conveniently missed out on the typhoon.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"24.338284, 124.157782","From":"Jul 28, 2018","To":"Jul 30, 2018","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"1","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"Osaka","Trip":"Pachinko and Prostitutes","Id":"214","Photo":"x","Description":"For some reason I didn\'t take notes on this trip.

We visited the National Museum of Art and learned about a few new Japanese artists. I listened to a wonderful street performer who sounded like a one man Sigur Ros. We actually tried Pachinko.

The musician proceed to take the plate around the restaurant and feed the very hot sauce to anyone who would accept, which was pretty much everyone.

There was a plaque detailing the absolutely devastating suicides of entire families who huddled around grenades and strangled themselves with torn cloth in fear of what the American soldiers would do to them when they invaded. We cruised the island and found an observation spot. We peered through some unfocused binoculars. We then fad taco rice and a karaage bowl and saw many cats in a small town. To the beach.

Dara picks us up again and takes us to Kampong Phluk floating village. It is quite pricey and our \'tour\' boat was driven by a 12-year-old boy. We pass a pretty village. He pulls over and we were told to get off the boat. We are then told to pay more for a different boat (a rowboat through the mangroves we would soon find out). It may have been nice, but we aren\'t expecting any of this sudden change and are already unhappy about paying so much for the initial tickets so we say no and got back on the first boat. It is weird and we feel pretty uncomfortable. By the mangroves and then to a big lake. We sit there for a few min still on the water and then went back. We can\'t find Dara at first. When we do we complain a bit to him and he seems to feel quite bad. To Bakong, our final temple. He buys us a coconut to apologize for the bad time we had.

It is early, but our hotel lets us into our room anyway. After a shower and na we head to Hong Kong Station for dim sum at Tim Ho Wan. We get pork buns, rib meat, dumplings, beef balls. The tea tastes a bit like dirt. We head to Victoria Peak. There is a long line for the tram up. It is very crowded at the top and feels like being in a mall. After much waiting we get a pretty nice spot up front. The timing is just right and we watch the sky turn dark and the city turn bright. It is quite beautiful. A girl pushes Liz\'s head over with her selfie stick. I call her out for it and she seems embarrassed. As we\'re leaving she apologizes to me and Liz, which I appreciate. Back into the city for a roast goose and sweet pork soup. Next to Honi Honi for some nice drinks.<br><br>We get up and head east to a food market. The first area we check out is mostly raw ingredients, but we soon find the cooked stuff. We split a yummy roast duck. Next we head to a nice coffee shop for cold brew and a smoked milk affogato. The barista is playing with this funny toy think. She tells us it\'s called a fidget spinner. From there we go to the Ladies Market. I buy a spinner, then immediately get a Baader-Meinhof for them because I realize every tenth person I see is playing with one. We get foot massages. More Ladies Market. I buy a wallet. To Kowloon Park. There is a row of anime statues. I don\'t know any of them. To a street standing spot for pan-fried soup pork buns. When Liz bites into her first one the hot juice squirts right up her nose and burns her bad. It hurts for a few days afterward. That aside the dumplings are fantastic. We eat them all, albeit more slowly. We wander a bit before heading back. McDonald\'s burgers and sleep.<br><br>I forget to tell Liz Happy Birthday. Before long she reminds me. At around 11 I head to a nearby street market. I get char siu bao, har gow, pringles, and milk tea and bring them back to Liz for breakfast in bed. We have a lazy morning and finally leave around 3. We grab a quick kebab and head to the Hong Kong History Museum. We learn that the British were the worst, like by starting the opium epidemic to promote trade in the region. There are a few tall towers of bao. We learn Japan also was terrible for quite a while.

Soon I pop out and snack on Dutch chips with mayo and satay from a nearby street vendor. I wander and soon stumble upon the Auckland Arts Fest. There I and listen to a nice Gypsy Jazz band. Back to the hotel where I work for a bit. I decide to walk to Ponsonby. And find a restaurant called Orphan\'s Kitchen for dinner. It is small and quaint, but I can tell immediately that they will serve some good food. I am not let down. I get house bread with browned butter, pan seared line caught fish and a beer.<br><br>I sleep in a bit and have an early lunch at Federal Delicatessen of a tuna fish sandwich & coffee. I walk up to and around the wharf area, which is undergoing gentrification. I pass an older man s playing haunting, ethereal music on an erhu. A bit further on an older folk duo couple are playing banjo & guitar and singing hymns. I head back to the wharf and meet Liz plus some of her colleagues for a dinner and drinks. From there we head to Housebar for a Penicillin and a Floral Fizz.<br><br>I work and have ramen for lunch. Liz and I head to Blue Breeze for a very good Polynesian themed dinner and Tiki drinks.<br><br>We rent a car and drive south through heavy rain. The rain is so bad we are worried our Hobbiton tour may be canceled. We stop by a store and pick up some rain gear. Just before we arrived to Hobbiton the rain stops completely. The tour goes forward and everything is perfect. We meet at the visitors center and then they drive us on a shuttle into the Shire. We enter through the cutout path Gandalf and Frodo ride into town on. This place is magical and transports me right into Middle Earth. We get to see Bag End, Bagshot row, the Party Tree, Sam\'s house with Rosie, and many other beautiful hobbit holes before we stop for a pint (it comes in pints!) at the Green Dragon. We buy Bilbo\'s famous sign for Richard\'s 60th birthday. From there we head east and stop at a beach on the coast before making south to Whakatane. I meet Juanita, who is amazing and lovely. She then gives us a tour around the bay and then takes us out for a dinner of venison and tempeh.<br><br>Juanita makes us tea and then takes us to the water...she is going to teach us to surf. She has all the gear and takes us out on the water. She is super patient and encouraging. A few times I manage to stand up briefly, which feels pretty cool. We head back, shower and then head for breakfast and coffee in a local cafe. She then shows us a Maori temple, which is beautiful. After that she takes us to some hot springs. She rents Liz and I a private cabana where we enjoy the water for a good while.

Out for more cocktails at Bulletin Place.<br><br>Liz and I have breakfast in the hotel. She is here for work so I\'ve got the day to myself. Henry Dupuis lives in a nearby town called Katoomba so we plan to hang for the day. I take an hour train ride east, into the mountains and Henry meets me at Katoomb station. He takes me to a cafe and we catch up for a bit. We explore downtown and stop for drinks and wings at a palimpsest pub, which used to be a bank. A local man tells us that the center of the universe is out in the bush. The bartender gives us a shrug implying this happens a lot. We go to meet Henry\'s partner, Marion, who is working at the local bra shop. From there he and I tour the antique mall. We pick up beers and head to Blackheath, where he lives in a large Victorian house with a few friends. He shows me their big garden and we listen to records in the parlor. I find a big scary spider in the closet. Nobody seems to mind.

It is harrowing, exciting, and smelly. The port is very touristy so we soon take the cable car up. Nap. To Santo Winery where we hang for a few hours and do a tasting of 18 wines and eat more cheese than we knew possible.

The chef on board serves us a lunch of salmon, whale, rice, salad, and bread. We cruise by a massive glacier. It is the first glacier I had ever seen and it is awe inspiring. We hoped to make it on land to Pyramiden (an abandoned Russian mining town), but the tell us there is still too much ice blocking the way. It is very cold in the boat and not comfortable. We pass by a tiny cabin where, almost 100 years ago, a dozen men died because they were stuck there for a winter and got lead poisoning from cooking their food in the can instead of transferring them to pots.

Liz and I make asparagus pesto spaghetti and cold chocolate bulges for our hosts.<br><br>For breakfast Omar makes arepas with black beans, butter, and cheese as well as coffee, bacon, and meatballs. The arepas are warm, chewy, and slightly crispy bits of masa, which is a common dish in his home country of Venezuela. We all stroll together outside and admire at the lovely homes. We see a dog bar, an orange barn, and some very black houses. To Vigelandsparken, a big park in the middle of the city, and take in many interesting concrete statues such as a baby, women with aliens, angry men, a girl with a unicorn, and Monolitten, 17 meters of bodies shaped into a monolith.

There is a special event on the 2nd floor, which we happen to catch in perfect time. The Shapes, a punk band from Coventry in the 70\'s, is here and talking with a small crowd. They answer question, tell entertaining stories and play a few songs. Their big hit is called Batman in the Launderette. Afterward we take photos with them. We walked with a few of the band members to their car so we can buy a vinyl, which they sign for us. Back to the museum to take it in. There is a lots of great two-tone memorabila. We meet a docent, who is the mother of the lead singer from the Primitives. We get some vinyl from the gift shop before heading out. We wander the university and cathedral area, then snack on grapes and and encounter some inconsiderate footballers outside of the Museum of Transportation. We learn that Coventry was the UK\'s Motor City. There are some very cool vintage bicycles on display. Halfway through the museum they close for the day. We eat some very Chinese food then pick up beer and artichoke hearts from the store for our couchsurfing hosts, Marie & Joe. They make us tea and Liz works on a puzzle. We discuss slugs, laundry, gender, and history before having a cold & uncomfortable sleep on the floor.<br><br>We chat a bit more and then out. To Hampstead cafe and then the big cathedral, which had been badly bombed in World War #2. The town has done much restoration work over the years and it is very beautiful now. There are many diverse features and intricate designs set in a humble and minimalist space. Across the street, in the Herbert Art Gallery, is a Grayson Perry exhibit so we head there next. There are something like eight large tapestries primarily inspired by the Rake\'s Progress. They are quite cool and we spend a good hour taking them all in. There is also a TV program playing in a side room where Grayson explore people\'s homes. We head back to the Transport Museum to do the 2nd half. After that it\'s beetroot chutney, beef rib ramen, and soft shell crab tempura before catching the train back to London.","WindowPlacement":"r","LatLng":"52.410455, -1.483671","From":"Apr 23, 2016","To":"Apr 24, 2016","People":"","Locations":"","NumberInTrip":"1","One":"","Two":"","Three":"","Four":"","Five":"","Six":"","Seven":"","Eight":"","Nine":"","Ten":"","Eleven":"","Twelve":"","Thirteen":"","PhotoAlbum":""},{"City":"Brussels","Trip":"Treats in","Id":"126","Photo":"x","Description":"Night bus, ferry, bus.

We drink beer on the floor and then he takes us to a pub with a chair nailed up on the wall. He tells us that Roger Daltrey once sat in it. A young guy is performing on acoustic guitar and does a pretty bad job of a Matchbox 20 song. To another pub. This one has a nu goth punk band playing.

To our B&B, which is absolutely precious. Our room is the Romantic Suite and is decorated in all things pink. It is gaudy, over the top, and absolutely charming. There are delicious little treats hidden all around the room. This is Alice in Wonderland, withouth all of the killing. After a while we head out to explore the castle and take in the sights. We lay by the river for a while. When the sun goes down we find a quaint spot for where we drank spritzes and eat donkey ragu, sardine & fennel macaroni, and gelato.

Instead we opt for pretty good pizza and a bland kebab across the street. After a long walk in the snow we reach a bonfire on the river, which we learned is a celebration point for the new year festivities. It is deserted, but warm. From there walk a short distance to our hostel where we meet our roommates for the night.¬†They are a man and woman, both geologists. We hit it off right away. Just before midnight we run back out to the bonfire and are just in time for the fireworks. They are not launched from a central spot, but rather from all around the city. The effect is that we are, for a short time, encircled by a forest of sparkling light. It is magical. Right there in the snow Liz pops open a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and we have a toast to the new year. Back inside we learn about cattle hydration and tectonic plates. I snore all night, apparently.

Then to the big church. We miss mass, but are still able to hear a man play the rich, atmospheric organ. The sun is going down and we walk along the water with hopes of catching the Aurora Borealis. Dinner is tasty Thai noodles followed by drink in the London Underground themed Kaffibarinn. At the hostel we watch Smarter Brother.<br><br>We get killer bagels from Kaffitar and then head to the Phallological Museum where we disover just how unsexy penises can be. A dog jumps on me. A quick snack of more hot dogs from B√¶jarins (they were so good) and then fish stew, a fish kebab, and a potato kebab at Sea Baron. We catch a bus for our Northern Lights tour. They drive us about 30 minutes outside of the city to a place which is meant to be a great viewing spot. We dont\'t see any with our eyeballs, but I take many long-exposure shots that catch some very pretty shades of green.

In thirty minutes I am at Arvi Park. I get lulo juice and grilled mushrooms from a street vendor and then proceed to wander through manicured and paved mountain trails for a couple of hours. I get some fresh fruit with yogurt from another cart vendor. On my way back, I get off at the favela station halfway down the mountain. It is festive, lively, colorful. I get looks from locals that seem to inform me this is not the place for tourists. I head to El Poblado, a place meant for tourists. I eat a bad carne fajita cone from a clean corporate fast food restaurant. I want to hear some live music. I find a group, but they are busking directly to couples on the street and mostly interested in tips. A man wearing nearly twenty stacked hats follows in their wake, hoping to capitalize off of the festive spirit the musicians bring. I find a rock cover band playing the Cranberries \\"Zombie\\" at a bar. I stay and have what I hope is Calamari.<br><br>Hostel breakfast and then to Plaza Botero. An older, vagrant man has a small crowd around him. I\'m not sure if he is an entertainer, a preacher, or mentally ill. He takes a lit cigarette and places it into a toy gorilla\'s mouth. Next he makes tubes by rolling up paper. He takes out a razor blade, demonstrates that it is very sharp by slicing up pieces of newspaper with it, and then runs it along his neck and the palm of his hand. It doesn\'t part his skin. He then unbuttons his shirt to reveal his nipple, which is pierced with a safety pin. Hanging from the pin is a small cloth bag. He opens it, which contains a few diamond shaped black pebbles. He lifts up a cup of what looks like water with food coloring in it. He places the stones in the water. They absorb all of the color, turning the water clear. I can\'t read the expressions of the faces of the crowd, but none of them look as confused as I surely do. I leave. In the museum, I take in the beauty of the voluminous Botero figures. I walk to Pergamino where I have a tasty coffee and watched the f√∫tbol game with a room of about 60 people. Colombia wins. The streets are a joyous party for the rest of the evening.

Back to the airport to rent a car. The automatics are about 3x more than the manuals, so we get a manual. Up until this point, I have basically never driven one though. I practice trying not to stall in the parking lot for quite a while and then start driving around the island. With the exception of a rough start, a few stalls, and not figuring out how to put it in reverse, I think it\'s going okay. We drive up and down the cost and tour the island. We stay in a hostel, but it is quiet and we get a private room. The other residents are mostly professional-aspiring surfers. We meet a lovely man from South Africa named Reese, who has been living here for three months in preparation to surf what he calls his Mecca. We have a burger in a Las Vegas themed restaurant then drive to the end of Tahiti Iti. Back to the hostel where we make coconut tuna with carrots and share with the other guests.<br><br>On our way back up we stop by a water logged cave and a very old temple complex, which feels rather Mayan. Liz and I lie on the grass and watch the birds flying overhead. They have long tails which gave them a beautiful silhouette.

We let cool down for a few and make it back. I neglect to mention the smoke. We take a bus into town where we find a cheap hostel and wander downtown.

In the afternoon we play mini golf and go snorkeling. We take a boat to the main island for dinner at Maikai Marina: ribeye w/blue cheese sauce and tuna carpaccio.<br><br>There is an incredible breakfast buffet.

We check out and head to the main island and into a quaint B&B. We head into the town Vaitape and watch some of the Heiva celebrations. The dancing and music are incredible and unlike anything I have ever heard. There are about twenty instruments similar to ukuleles strumming very quickly. Some men percuss hollow logs. Women sing quickly and in rich harmonies. We find a seafood tent further down the beach an order a massive raw tuna plate and a shrimp curry. I am hot and I decide to cut my jeans into shorts in the toilet with a steak knife. We walk through a casino inside another tent where some children are playing roulette. An nice older man sees our interest and gives Liz a few chips, which we quickly lose. <br><br>We have a boat excursion planned for today. The first spot is a reef where we snorkel and see many colorful fish. Next is the black fin shark feeding area where we are surrounded by about 20 sharks. We stop at a deserted island for a lunch of BBQ fish, coconut ceviche, taro, tapioca, coconut bread, banana bread pudding, watermelon and grapefruit. We fill up. Next is a long ride to a sandbar with stingray. The guides show us how to grab the rays\' nose and ride them. I try. After a few unsuccessful attempts, I get a hold of one and one who quickly rams my head into the side of the boat.

I find an octopus curled up on a rock. I accidentally frighten it and it squirts ink at me. I decide to swim around the island. This is a stupid idea. It is quite wavy and rocky and takes about 20 minutes. When I come back around everyone is already back in the boat and waiting for me. Back to Isla Tortuga where we have pineapple, watermelon, beer, fish stew, and potatoes.

While we aren\'t quite foolish enough to fall for the Chinese tea trick (we make sure the menu had prices listed).

We tell him we\'re leaving and he says he\'ll check back in on us after lunch. We go the hostel and cancel our reservation. Surprisingly, they give us a full refund. We find another very cute hotel with a pool and have some tiki drinks at the bar.

We sit on steps outside the museum and eat ice cream. There is a wild-looking, hairy, potentially-vagrant man doing some of the best street comedy I have ever seen. He will walk behind a very posh woman an mimic her gate. She is unaware, but the audience on the steps eats it up. He runs up to a man on his phone and screams.
